## What is Knit

Knit is an **offline peer-to-peer messaging app for Android** that needs no internet connection, no
cell service, no accounts, and no servers. It forms an ad-hoc **mesh** directly over **Wi-Fi Aware
(NAN)** and **Bluetooth LE**, running both radios at once. When you send a message, it's transmitted
to every device in range; each of those re-transmits it onward, so messages "leap-frog" across many
phones with **no infrastructure**. Duplicate copies are discarded, hop-count and TTL bound the flood,
and a store-and-forward layer carries what a single flood doesn't reach. The interface is a modern,
Signal-style messenger.

It is comparable to apps like Bridgefy, Briar, or Meshtastic, but distinguished by running **two radios
simultaneously** (Wi-Fi Aware + BLE) behind one transport seam, with **no Google Nearby / GMS
dependency** and **end-to-end encryption** on direct and group messages.

> [!NOTE]
> **Status — v2.1.** Feature-complete for launch: a **"Nearby" public broadcast room**, **1:1 direct
> messages**, and **multi-member group chats**, with profiles (name / status / avatar), emoji
> reactions, @-mentions, and image attachments. **Direct and group messages are end-to-end
> encrypted** — bodies, mentions, and image attachments are readable only by their intended recipients,
> even though every message floods through relay devices. The public Nearby room is plaintext by design
> (no fixed recipient set). See the [Security note](#-security-note).

## How it works

```
   ┌─────────┐   Wi-Fi Aware / BLE   ┌─────────┐   Wi-Fi Aware / BLE   ┌─────────┐
   │ Phone A │ ────────────────────► │ Phone B │ ────────────────────► │ Phone C │
   └─────────┘   send + relay        └─────────┘   relay (dedup)       └─────────┘
        │                                 │                                 │
   originates a           overhears & re-floods (jittered,          delivers — even though
   signed, encrypted      suppressed) — only carries ciphertext     A was never in its range
   frame once             it can't decrypt
```

Every message is a signed CBOR frame that relays forward **byte-for-byte** (they rewrite only
TTL/hop-count), so the originator's Ed25519 signature survives every hop. A relay that can't decrypt or
even recognize a frame still forwards it — an old build is never a black hole. See
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full protocol.

## 🧭 Use it when

Knit is built for situations where there's **no reliable network but people are physically nearby**:

- **Off-grid & remote** — hiking, camping, festivals, sailing, or anywhere without cell coverage.
- **Disaster & emergency** — earthquakes, storms, or outages that knock out cell towers and internet.
- **Crowded venues** — concerts, stadiums, and conferences where the cellular network is saturated.
- **Privacy-sensitive** — no servers, no accounts, no phone numbers; DMs and groups are end-to-end
  encrypted and identities are verifiable in person via safety numbers / QR codes.
- **Censored or shut-down networks** — communication that doesn't depend on any ISP or provider.

## ✨ Features

- **Dual-radio mesh relay** — **Wi-Fi Aware (NAN)** and **Bluetooth LE** run *simultaneously* behind a
  single `MeshTransport` seam (`CompositeMeshTransport`), no Google Nearby / GMS. Advertise + discover,
  connect to nearby peers, and flood with hop-count/TTL bounds and dedup. Relays use **jittered,
  overhear-suppressed** flooding so a dense cluster isn't stormed with redundant rebroadcasts. A device
  with only one of the two radios still meshes over that one.
- **Broadcast room, 1:1 DMs, and group chats** — a conversation list and contact picker, message
  bubbles, relative timestamps, unread badges, and delivery ticks (✓ / ✓✓).
- **End-to-end encryption** for DMs and groups — each message's body, mentions, and image attachment are
  sealed with a fresh per-message key (AES-256-GCM), wrapped to each recipient (Tink HPKE/X25519), and
  authenticated with an Ed25519 signature, so relays only ever carry ciphertext. Identity keypairs are
  **hardware-backed** (AndroidKeyStore), advertised in profiles, pinned on first use (TOFU), and
  confirmable out of band via a **safety-number / QR-code** verification screen.
- **Store-and-forward delivery** — a message whose recipient isn't in range is held in encrypted custody
  and re-offered when they (or a path to them) later come into range, so two phones that meet only
  briefly still backfill each other. A content-digest anti-entropy layer means an idle mesh does zero
  data-path work; a new message triggers a targeted sync only with the peers that need it.
- **Reactions, @-mentions, and image attachments** — emoji reactions converge across the mesh
  (last-writer-wins); mentions get a dedicated notification; images (GIF/JPEG/PNG/WebP) are
  content-addressed and pulled on demand so the bytes don't ride the flood (encrypted attachments are
  addressed by ciphertext hash, so dedup/pull is unchanged).
- **Profiles** — display name, status, and avatar flooded across the mesh; avatars transferred as files
  (re-pushed only when they actually change) and shown next to messages.
- **On-device content moderation** — abusive-text and explicit-image (NSFW) filtering that runs
  **entirely offline** (no network, no server): a deterministic profanity filter, a bundled TFLite
  **toxicity** text classifier, and a bundled TFLite **NSFW** image classifier. Abusive **text is
  blocked on send**; explicit **images** are blocked outright in the public Nearby room and
  **allowed-but-discouraged via a "send anyway?" confirmation** in DMs/groups; both are
  **collapsed/blurred behind tap-to-reveal on receive** (receiver-side enforcement is what actually
  protects a user in a mesh), with one-tap block-sender and a user toggle. See
  [`docs/CONTENT_MODERATION.md`](docs/CONTENT_MODERATION.md).
- **Messaging-style notifications** with per-context channels (Nearby, groups, DMs) and a separate
  channel for mentions.
- **Always-on background mesh** via a foreground service, kept healthy by a heartbeat alarm,
  significant-motion re-scan, and radio-availability recovery; prompts to disable battery optimization.
- **Offline app sharing** — hand Knit to a nearby phone with no store: the installed splits are merged
  into a universal APK and re-signed on-device (ARSCLib + apksig).
- **Material 3** UI with a coral brand theme and full dark mode; encrypted at rest (SQLCipher).

## 📋 Requirements

- **Android 10 (API 29) or newer**, with **Wi-Fi Aware** and/or **Bluetooth LE** hardware. Nearly all
  phones have BLE; Wi-Fi Aware is on Pixel 3+ and many recent devices. A device with only one radio
  still meshes over it — the app is unsupported only when *neither* radio exists. No Google Play services
  required.
  - Wi-Fi Aware uses Instant Communication Mode + `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES` on **API 33+**, falling back to
    `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` (location-scoped, no ICM) on **API 29–32**.
- **JDK 21** and the **Android SDK** (compileSdk 36.1) to build.
- Real mesh testing needs **two or more physical devices** — see [Running](#-running).

## 🔨 Build

The source lives at **<https://github.com/getknit/knit>**. You need **JDK 21** and the
Android SDK (compileSdk 36.1) — Android Studio is optional. When building from the command line without
Studio, point Gradle at your SDK first: create a git-ignored `local.properties` containing
`sdk.dir=/path/to/Android/Sdk`, or export `ANDROID_HOME`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getknit/knit.git
cd knit
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug        # build the debug APK (does NOT compile test sources)
./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin   # fast compile check of main sources
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest    # JVM unit tests — mesh router, flood suppression, dedup, CBOR codec,
                                     # crypto, store-and-forward, + Robolectric Room/DAO & migration tests
./gradlew installDebug              # install on a connected device
./gradlew detekt ktlintCheck        # static analysis & style (Gradle plugins; ktlintFormat autoformats)
./gradlew :app:koverHtmlReportDebug # test coverage report
```

The debug APK lands at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

## 📱 Running

The mesh drives the Wi-Fi Aware and Bluetooth LE radios directly, so it needs **physical devices**:

1. Install the debug build on **two (or more) Wi-Fi-Aware- and/or Bluetooth-LE-capable phones**.
2. Launch on each, grant the requested permissions, and (recommended) allow background battery use.
3. Within range, the devices auto-discover and connect ("Connected to N mesh nodes" appears).
4. Send a message on one — it appears on the others; a third device out of direct range receives it
   relayed through the middle device.

The app launches and the UI works on an emulator, but an emulator cannot form a real mesh (it has no
Wi-Fi Aware or BLE peer radio), so use real devices for connectivity testing. Debug builds carry a
headless `am broadcast` bridge (`…debug.SEND` / `SENDIMG` / `STATE` / `STORE` / `REACT` / `HEAL`) so the
send→verify loop can be driven over `adb` without screenshots — see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## 🧪 Testing

- **JVM unit tests** — `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest` (mesh/protocol/data logic, plus Robolectric +
  in-memory Room DAO/migration and Compose-`*ScreenContent` tests). No device.
- **Seeded UI instrumentation tests** — a Compose/Espresso suite (`app/src/androidTest/…/ui/`) that renders
  every screen fully populated with **no radios**, to hunt device/API-specific UI quirks. It runs the
  demo-seeded build (`-PseedDemo=true`: a no-op transport + a seeded conversation history), so it works on an
  emulator or any device:

  ```bash
  ./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest -PseedDemo=true   # on every attached adb device/emulator
  ./gradlew :app:pixel7api33DebugAndroidTest -PseedDemo=true # on a Gradle-managed emulator only (Pixel 7 @ API 33)
  ```

  The `pixel7api33` variant is a **Gradle Managed Device**: Gradle boots a headless emulator, runs the suite,
  and tears it down — it never touches attached physical devices (which the plain `connected…` task would).

  Because the suite is radio-less it also runs unmodified on **Firebase Test Lab** physical devices: build the
  debug and debug-`androidTest` APKs (with `-PseedDemo=true`) and submit them with `gcloud firebase test android
  run` (Android Test Orchestrator, per-test isolation), capturing a screenshot per test per device. See
  [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the recommended device/API matrix and the free-tier budget.

- **Black-box UIAutomator tests** — a UIAutomator suite (`app/src/androidTest/…/uiauto/`) that drives the
  *real running app* through the accessibility / resource-id layer, so it reaches what the in-process Compose
  suite can't: the system **notification shade**, **process lifecycle** (Home / Recents / rotation), and real
  dropdown-menu / dialog **popups**. It shares the same demo-seeded, radio-less build. Run **all** of them
  locally on the Gradle-managed emulator (no physical device, no `adb` involvement):

  ```bash
  ./gradlew :app:pixel7api33DebugAndroidTest -PseedDemo=true \
    -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.package=app.getknit.knit.uiauto
  ```

  Drop the `-P…package` filter to run the seeded Compose suite alongside it, or submit the same APKs to Firebase
  Test Lab for the isolated physical-device pass. (Run a single class with
  `…arguments.class=app.getknit.knit.uiauto.OverflowNavigationUiAutomatorTest`.)

## ❓ FAQ

**Does Knit need the internet or a cell signal?**
No. Knit works entirely offline. Nearby phones connect directly over Wi-Fi Aware and Bluetooth LE and
relay messages for each other, so it needs neither internet, cellular, nor a Wi-Fi router.

**Does it require Google Play services or an account?**
No. There is no Google Nearby / GMS dependency — the radios are driven through framework APIs — and
there are no accounts, sign-ups, phone numbers, or servers.

**If it's offline, why does the app declare the `INTERNET` permission?**
Not to reach the internet. Wi-Fi Aware forms a direct radio link between two phones and runs a TCP
socket *over that local link* (link-local IPv6, no router or gateway), which Android gates behind the
`INTERNET` permission even though no traffic ever leaves the mesh. Knit contacts no servers and bundles
no analytics, telemetry, or crash reporting — you can confirm both from the source and the deliberately
GMS-free dependency list.

**How far can messages travel?**
Beyond direct radio range. Each phone relays for the others, so a message hops device-to-device across
the mesh; a store-and-forward layer also carries messages to recipients who come into range later.

**Are messages encrypted?**
1:1 direct messages and group chats are **end-to-end encrypted** (only the intended recipients can read
the body, mentions, and image attachments; relays carry only ciphertext). The public "Nearby" broadcast
room is plaintext by design, since it has no fixed recipient set. The local database is encrypted at
rest with SQLCipher.

**What phones does it support?**
Android 10 (API 29) and newer, with Wi-Fi Aware and/or Bluetooth LE. Almost all phones have BLE; Wi-Fi
Aware is on Pixel 3+ and many recent devices. A phone with only one of the two radios still meshes over
it.

**Is it free and open source?**
Yes — Knit is free software under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 or later**. There are no ads,
paid tiers, or subscriptions; development is funded entirely by optional tips (see [Support](#-support)).

**How is it different from Bridgefy / Briar / Meshtastic?**
Knit runs **two radios at once** (Wi-Fi Aware + Bluetooth LE) behind a single transport seam, has **no
Google Play services dependency**, end-to-end encrypts DMs and groups, and needs no dedicated hardware
(unlike Meshtastic's LoRa radios) — just an Android phone.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

**Implemented & verified:** broadcast room · 1:1 DMs · multi-member group chats · profiles · reactions ·
mentions · attachments · at-rest DB encryption (SQLCipher) · **E2E encryption + identity verification**
for DMs and groups · dual **Wi-Fi Aware + Bluetooth LE** transports behind `MeshTransport` (no GMS) ·
**store-and-forward** delay-tolerant delivery · **key-request / retransmit** for messages received before
a sender's key is known · on-device toxicity + NSFW moderation · offline app sharing.

**Explicitly deferred (don't start without direction):**

- **True DM routing** — DMs currently flood the whole mesh and only the addressed recipient delivers/
  acks; targeted multi-hop routing is future work.
- **Forward secrecy** — E2E uses long-term static identity keys (no ratchet), so compromise of a
  device's identity key would expose past intercepted messages.
- **Encrypting reactions, receipts, and the broadcast room** — these remain (signed) cleartext metadata.

## 🔐 Security note

**Direct and group messages are end-to-end encrypted.** Each message's content (body, mentions, image
attachment) is sealed with a fresh per-message key (AES-256-GCM); that key is wrapped to each recipient
with hybrid public-key encryption (Tink HPKE/X25519), and the whole envelope is signed with the sender's
Ed25519 key. Relays — which flood every message hop-by-hop — only ever see ciphertext, and only the
addressed recipient(s) can decrypt. Each device's identity keypair is generated on first run and stored
wrapped under a hardware-backed AndroidKeyStore key, outside the database.

Peers' keys are pinned on first use (TOFU); if a peer's key later changes, verification is reset and
flagged. Confirm a contact's key out of band — compare the **safety number** in person or scan their
**QR code** — to defend against a relay substituting keys.

**Caveats:** the public **Nearby broadcast room is plaintext** by design (no fixed recipient set).
Reactions and delivery receipts travel as **cleartext metadata** (signed, not encrypted). E2E uses
**static keys — no forward secrecy** (see the roadmap). The at-rest database is encrypted with SQLCipher.

To report a vulnerability, see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) — please **do not** open a public issue for
security problems.

## 💛 Support

Knit is free and open source, with no ads, no tracking, and nothing to sell you — it's funded entirely
by tips. If it's useful to you and you'd like to chip in, you can leave a one-off tip on Ko-fi or set up
a recurring one on Liberapay:

Tips are optional and buy no special treatment — Knit is GPLv3 and stays that way. Reporting bugs and
telling people it exists helps just as much.
