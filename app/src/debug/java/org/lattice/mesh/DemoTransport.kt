/**
 * A no-op [MeshTransport] used only by the demo builds. It never touches the radios — it simply
 * *reports* a set of connected neighbors so the "connected" header ([MeshManager.neighborCount]) and the
 * contact "online" dots light up against the seeded data, with no real mesh. Every other operation is inert.
 *
 * The neighbor set is injected as a [StateFlow] the caller owns: the static screenshot build
 * (`-PseedDemo=true`, [org.lattice.demo.DemoSeeder]) supplies a fixed set, while the trailer build
 * (`-PdemoDirector=true`, [org.lattice.demo.DemoDirector]) supplies a [MutableStateFlow] it grows over
 * the timeline so the "connected to N" header climbs live. [MeshTransport.reachable] defaults to
 * [neighbors], so this drives both.
