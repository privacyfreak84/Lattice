/**
 * Debug-only trailer director (`-PdemoDirector=true`). Plays a scripted, animated conversation on the
 * **Nearby** room so a screen recording becomes the promo trailer: the local user types + sends a message,
 * peers reply, more nodes join (the "connected to N" header climbs), and the room fills with photos, an
 * animated GIF, reactions, quoted replies, @-mentions, and "typing…" cues.
 *
 * It writes through [DemoWriter] (the same repository primitives the static [DemoSeeder] uses), so every
 * change animates into the live UI with no bespoke rendering — peer messages/reactions land via reactive
 * Room flows, the header climbs off the shared [roster] flow the no-op [com.dresos.lattice.mesh.DemoTransport]
 * reports, typing rides [MeshManager.seedDemoTyping]/[MeshManager.clearDemoTyping], and the local "type +
 * send" beats drive the real composer via [DemoComposer]. Nothing here compiles into release
 * ([BuildConfig.DEMO_DIRECTOR] is a compile-time false there and the class lives in `src/debug`).
