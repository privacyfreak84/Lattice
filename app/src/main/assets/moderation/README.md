# On-device content-moderation assets

Everything here is loaded locally at runtime — the app has **no `INTERNET` permission**, so models must
be **bundled**, never downloaded.

## `profanity_en.txt` (present)

Word list for the deterministic first pass of text moderation (`LexicalTextFilter`). **Generated file —
do not edit by hand**; regenerate with `python3 scripts/gen-profanity-list.py`. Produced from the
MIT-licensed `dsojevic/profanity-list` corpus (see [Attribution](#attribution) below): one single-token
base literal per line, curated to severity ≥ 2 with the `lgbtq` identity tag and common innocent words
excluded. Morphological derivatives and contextual cases are left to the ML toxicity classifier that
backstops the lexical pass.

## `nsfw.tflite` (bundled — activates image moderation)

The NSFW image classifier consumed by `NsfwImageModerator`. Currently the **GantMan `nsfw_model`
MobileNetV2 (140/224)**: input `[1,224,224,3]` float32 normalized `÷255`, softmax output `[1,5]` =
`drawings, hentai, neutral, porn, sexy`; the moderator flags on `hentai+porn+sexy ≥ 0.7`. ~17 MB float
model, **managed via Git LFS** (`.gitattributes` tracks `*.tflite`).

Shapes and input dtype are read from the model at load, so swapping in a compatible model "just works":
a MobileNet-style classifier with `[1,H,W,3]` input (float32 `[0,1]` or uint8 `0..255`) and `[1,N]`
output. A quantized `.tflite` (~4–5 MB) drops in unchanged. To use a model with a different class
layout, adjust `unsafeClasses`/`threshold` in `NsfwImageModerator`. If the file is **absent or fails to
load, the moderator degrades to allow-all** (hooks + blur UI stay wired).

License: **MIT** — GantMan `nsfw_model` (see the Attribution section below); redistributable in the APK.
Tune the threshold on-device. `*.tflite` is kept uncompressed in the APK
(`androidResources { noCompress }` in `app/build.gradle.kts`) so TFLite can mmap it.

## `toxicity.tflite` + `tokenizer.json` + `labels.txt` (bundled — activates text ML moderation)

The on-device toxicity classifier consumed by `MlTextModerator`, layered into `HybridTextModerator`
after the lexical pass (it only sees text the word list clears). **Detoxify "unbiased-small" (ALBERT)**
fine-tuned on the Jigsaw Unintended Bias dataset, exported to TFLite: inputs `input_ids` /
`attention_mask` `[1, 128]` (int), output `[1, 16]` sigmoid probabilities over the labels in
`labels.txt` — 7 toxicity labels (`toxicity, severe_toxicity, obscene, identity_attack, insult, threat,
sexual_explicit`) plus 9 identity-mention columns. ~14.6 MB dynamic-int8 model, **managed via Git LFS**
(`.gitattributes` tracks `*.tflite`).

**Selective blocking:** `MlTextModerator` enforces only a configured subset of categories — by default
`severe_toxicity`, `identity_attack`, `sexual_explicit`, `threat` (serious abuse) — and deliberately
ignores general `toxicity`/`insult`/`obscene` (rudeness) and the identity-mention columns. Tune
thresholds on-device.

`tokenizer.json` drives the pure-Kotlin `SentencePieceTokenizer` (no native library → 16 KB-page safe;
verified id-for-id against the HuggingFace tokenizer). If any asset is **absent or fails to load,
`MlTextModerator` degrades to allow-all** and the lexical pass still runs.

Produced (and re-tunable) by the separate `detoxify-mobile` conversion pipeline; license is Apache-2.0
(Detoxify weights + albert-base-v2) — retain attribution when shipping. Full design and wiring:
