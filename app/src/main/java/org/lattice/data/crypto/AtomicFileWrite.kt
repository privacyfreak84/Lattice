/**
 * Atomically (re)writes [bytes] to this file: writes to a sibling `.tmp`, fsyncs it, then atomically
 * renames it over the target. After this returns — or after a crash at any point — the target holds
 * either the complete previous contents or the complete new contents, **never** a truncated file.
 *
 * This matters because the callers' read paths treat a corrupt file as "key lost" and respond
 * *destructively*: [DatabaseKey] wipes the entire encrypted database, and [KeystoreSecret] (via
 * [IdentityKeyStore]) mints a fresh identity keypair — a new nodeId that breaks every peer's pinned key.
 * A plain [File.writeBytes] truncates the live file first, so a mid-write crash could trigger exactly
 * those destructive fallbacks. See ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md item #12.
 *
 * Hardens the [org.lattice.ui.invite.ApkMerger] temp+rename precedent with an fsync and
 * `ATOMIC_MOVE` (vs. [File.renameTo]), since the blast radius here is the DB/identity rather than a
 * re-mergeable APK. The temp sibling lives in the same directory so the rename stays on one filesystem
 * (required for [StandardCopyOption.ATOMIC_MOVE]).
