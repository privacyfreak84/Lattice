     * (accepted / verified / previously DM'd), the group isn't a stranger's cold request — someone you

     * not mere membership: a stranger who merely *adds* you to a group alongside a contact stays a request
     * until a known peer actually posts. A sender counts by the same three DM signals, so this can't accept
     * a group nobody-you-know has spoken in. [groupSenders] defaults empty for DM/Nearby ids and for group
     * checks made without the thread's senders in hand (those still need an explicit accept or a
     * self-authored reply). Convergence-safe: a local presentation decision only (never folded into custody/relay).
