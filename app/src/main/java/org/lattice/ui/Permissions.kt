/**
 * Runtime permissions the mesh needs across both transport planes, **tiered by API level** — the permission
 * model changed twice under us, so a single static list would wedge onboarding below API 33 (an ungrantable
 * permission would keep [hasAllMeshPermissions] false forever):
 *
 * - **API 33+** — location-free. Wi-Fi Aware discovery rides `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES` (`neverForLocation`) and
 *   BLE rides the split `BLUETOOTH_SCAN`/`ADVERTISE`/`CONNECT` (`BLUETOOTH_SCAN` also `neverForLocation`;
 *   identity is the nodeId, RSSI is proximity-only). `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` is a runtime permission here too.
 * - **API 31-32** — the split BLE permissions exist, but Wi-Fi Aware discovery has no `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES`
 *   yet, so it needs `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` + `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` (Android 12 requires the pair — the
 *   precise/approximate toggle; there is no `neverForLocation` escape before API 31). Neither
 *   `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES` nor `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` is a runtime permission pre-33.
 * - **API 29-30** — no split BLE permissions; BLE scan *and* Wi-Fi Aware discovery both need fine location
 *   (`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` + `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`). Legacy `BLUETOOTH`/`BLUETOOTH_ADMIN` are install-time
 *   (normal) permissions auto-granted from the manifest, so they are not requested here.
 *
 * A device missing either radio is handled at runtime (the transport self-degrades and the composite runs
 * whichever plane is present), so an unused permission on a given device is simply a grant never exercised.
 * [sdkInt] is injectable (default [Build.VERSION.SDK_INT]) so the tiering is a pure, unit-testable function.
