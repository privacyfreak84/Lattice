/**
 * Decodes a QR code out of a raw camera luminance (Y) plane. **Deliberately Android-free** — zxing core is
 * pure Java, so this whole object is a plain-JVM unit-test target ([org.lattice.ui.scan.QrDecoderTest]);
 * the Android/CameraX adapter lives in `QrScannerContent`.
 *
 * This file exists because the library it replaced got exactly this arithmetic wrong.
 * `com.journeyapps:zxing-android-embedded` ran its decode loop on a bare `HandlerThread` with no `try`/
 * `catch` anywhere in the chain, and cropped the preview buffer using the frame size the camera *reported*
 * rather than the one it *delivered*. On a device where those disagree — ordinary camera-HAL variance —
 * `System.arraycopy` threw `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` off the main thread and killed the process
 * (the F-Droid crash report against 2.2.1). So the invariant here is absolute:
 *
 * > **[decode] never throws.** Any frame — truncated, mis-strided, absurdly sized, or simply without a
 * > code in it — yields `null`. A camera frame must not be able to take the app down.
 *
 * Rotation is not handled, and doesn't need to be: zxing locates a QR code by its finder patterns in any
 * orientation, which is what lets us drop the rotate-and-crop stage that caused the crash.
