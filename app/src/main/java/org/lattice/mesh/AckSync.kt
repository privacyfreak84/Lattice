/**
 * Delay-tolerant delivery of a **broadcast/group** message's "delivered" tick back to its author.
 *
 * A DM receipt floods and is store-and-forward custodied, so it reaches the sender across hops and time.
 * Broadcast and group messages have no single recipient, so their receipt is deliberately a lighter,
 * unicast, point-to-point tick — `relay = false`, so it neither floods nor is custodied — sent straight to
 * the author over [MeshTransport.fastSend]. That one-shot best-effort tick is lost for good if the author
 * isn't reachable from us at the instant we deliver the message: exactly the store-and-forward / out-of-range
 * case, where the *message* converges via custody but the tick never does, so the author's UI shows no ✓✓
 * even after everything else caught up.
 *
 * This closes that gap **without an ack storm**: we remember the ticks we owe ([owe]) and re-send them —
 * still unicast, still `relay = false`, never flooded — until the author becomes reachable or the entry ages
 * out. When the author is a *live neighbor* we send over that link (reliable) and drop the entry; otherwise we
 * best-effort fast-send over the coordination plane and keep retrying on every newcomer ([onNeighborAdded])
 * and heartbeat ([retryPending]). [MessageRepository.markReceived] is idempotent, so a duplicate tick
 * (multiple recipients, or a retry after one already landed) is harmless — one surviving receipt is all the
 * "≥1 person received it" tick needs, and [ForwardSync.onAck] is a no-op for a receipt whose acked message
 * has no DM recipient, so retries can never evict custody.
 *
 * In-memory and bounded (global [cap], per-entry [ttlMs]) like [KeyExchange]/[PendingInbound]: an unsent owed
 * tick self-repopulates when the message re-serves through the deliver path (which re-calls [owe]), so a
 * restart before convergence loses nothing durable. Pure (transport/identity/signer/clock injected) ⇒
 * unit-tested with [FakeLoopTransport] (see `AckSyncTest`).
