/**
 * The inbound half of the mesh, extracted from [MeshManager]: it owns delivery of every frame the router
 * hands up — authenticate ([verifyInbound]), custody ([onDeliver]'s pre-relay [ForwardSync.onSeen]),
 * dispatch by type, decrypt, persist, notify, ack — plus the store-and-forward carry gate ([canCarry]) and
 * the avatar/group-photo/attachment screening. Pulled out so the security gate and its three load-bearing
 * ordering contracts are a focused, JVM-testable unit ([onDeliver] is directly drivable — see
 * `InboundPipelineTest`):
 *
 *  - **custody-before-relay** — [onDeliver] carries a floodable frame ([ForwardSync.onSeen], `ORIGIN_RELAY`)
 *    before dispatch returns and before the router schedules the relay, so the copy is durable pre-flood.
 *  - **replay-runs-last** — [handleProfile] pins the sender's key, then replays any frames parked in
 *    [PendingInbound] by re-entering [onDeliver] as its **last** step, so the key + any deviceTag block are
 *    applied first.
 *  - **no-throw-out-of-onDeliver** — [verifyInbound]/[decrypt] are `runCatching`-wrapped so a failure drops
 *    the frame locally but never throws, letting the router still relay it (it runs after onDeliver returns).
 *
 * [MeshManager] still **owns** the six DTN services and the outbound origination choke; this pipeline
 * receives the services by reference and reaches origination through the [originate]/[flushPending] lambdas
 * (and moderation through [classifyText]) — the same lambda-mediation the DTN services already use. It holds
 * no coroutine/session state, so it needs no start/stop hooks.
