 * Content-addressed image-blob storage, abstracted so [BlobExchange] stays free of Android/Room
 * dependencies (and unit-testable). The app's implementation is backed by the encrypted database (see
 * `MeshBlobStore`); the methods are `suspend` because they read/write that database. Mesh file transfers
 * are inherently file-based (streamed over the data-path socket), so [fileFor]/[saveIncoming] still trade
 * in [File]s — the implementation
 * materializes short-lived temp files for in-flight transfers.
