/**
 * The mesh protocol version and capability registry, plus the codec for the endpoint-info advert string.
 *
 * A peer advertises `nodeId|version|capabilitiesHex` in its discovery advert ([advertise]) — the Wi-Fi
 * Aware `serviceSpecificInfo` or the BLE service-data payload; a peer
 * that only knows the bare nodeId (a legacy/unknown build) parses to version 0 / no capabilities
 * ([parse], which never throws). This is the *unauthenticated* connection-time hint — known before a
 * single frame flows — used only as a routing/degradation signal, never for trust (trust stays on the
 * signature path). The same [VERSION]/[capabilities][LOCAL_CAPABILITIES] also ride, authenticated, on
 * [ProfileContent] so a peer reachable only via relay still learns them.
 *
 * Pure (no Android), so it is JVM-unit-testable alongside the other `mesh/protocol` logic.
 *
 * Append-only: [CAP_*] bit positions are never reused and [VERSION] only increases.

     * frame-global custody eviction key and the local sort key, so an unbounded future value is a weapon:
     * a custody frame future-dated past this window is refused at store time
     * ([org.lattice.data.forward.ForwardRepository.store]) so it can't become un-sweepable and win
     * every oldest-by-`sentAt` eviction (a handful of Sybil identities would otherwise displace all honest
     * custody mesh-wide), and an inbound chat's stored `sentAt` is clamped to it
     * ([org.lattice.mesh.InboundPipeline.deliverChat]) so a future-dated frame can't pin itself to the
     * top of a conversation forever. 5 min tolerates an unsynced device without giving an attacker a usable
     * window. Every node compares against its own `now`, exactly like the dead-on-arrival lower bound, so an
     * honest frame (`sentAt ≈ now`) passes on every node and only the attacker's window closes.
