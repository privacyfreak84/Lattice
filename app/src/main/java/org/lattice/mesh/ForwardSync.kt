/**
 * Store-and-forward custody for chat messages — 1:1 DMs, group messages, and the broadcast room. The
 * mesh floods a frame once and drops it, so a message whose recipient (or a path to them) isn't
 * connected at that instant never arrives. [ForwardSync] persists the messages a node originates or
 * relays ([onSeen]) and, when a neighbor joins ([onNeighborAdded]), unicasts the carried ones to it:
 *
 * - **DMs** are offered to any newcomer: if it's the recipient it delivers + acks; otherwise its normal
 *   relay floods the frame onward through the new topology. A delivery receipt from the addressed
 *   recipient purges the carried copy mesh-wide ([onAck]).
 * - **Group messages** are offered only to a roster member (the member set rides in cleartext on the
 *   frame); once any member receives it, the normal flood re-distributes it to the rest. A group has no
 *   single recipient and no reliable per-member ack, so it is never vaccine-purged — the TTL/cap sweep
 *   is its only bound.
 * - **Broadcast-room** messages are offered to every newcomer (no destination to target), so two phones
 *   that meet only briefly backfill each other's ambient history. Like a group they have no ack, so the
 *   (shorter) TTL/cap sweep is their only bound.
 *
 * Pure (no Android/Room): the transport and store are injected and authentication is a lambda, so the
 * whole flow is unit-testable with [FakeLoopTransport] and a fake [ForwardStore].
