/**
 * TTL'd set of peers a **bulk (attachment) transfer** is pending with — the state behind
 * [org.lattice.mesh.MeshTransport.expectBulkTransfer] on the Wi-Fi Aware plane. A noted peer counts as
 * sync-wanted at the NDP *admission* sites only (`driveSync`/`initiateOwed`/`initiateOwedToReachable`),
 * punching through digest parity and BLE-coverage suppression just long enough to raise a data path for the
 * file; it deliberately never feeds the recovery machinery (wedge watchdog, subscribe re-arm, ICM relight) —
 * a pending image has the Bluetooth fallback carrying it, so there is no outage to heal and nothing worth
 * churning discovery (or running the owed-episode clock toward a self-kill) over.
 *
 * Bounded three ways so a mark can never pin the radio:
 * - a sliding [ttlMs] per entry (re-armed only by [note], i.e. a fresh want/serve attempt — never by reads);
 * - a [maxEntries] cap (oldest-expiry evicted — realistic bulk demand is one or two peers);
 * - a per-peer [failCooldownMs] after [noteFailed] (a failed initiate), so the 60 s blobreq re-offer can't
 *   re-mark a NAN-dark peer into an initiate→timeout loop on the single NDI.
 *
 * Cleared eagerly on link-up to the peer ([clear] — the mark's job is done; the transfer either rides the
 * link or the next attempt re-marks) and on transport stop ([clearAll]). Pure (no Android deps) ⇒
 * JVM-unit-tested ([org.lattice.BulkWantTrackerTest]); `@Synchronized` for the transport's
 * callback-thread vs. loop-coroutine access; the transport injects `SystemClock::elapsedRealtime`.
