/**
 * Routes text moderation by conversation scope. The public Nearby broadcast room runs the full hybrid
 * pass — the deterministic profanity word-list ([LexicalTextFilter]) first, then the ML toxicity
 * classifier ([MlTextModerator]) on anything it clears — while private DMs and groups run the toxicity
 * classifier only. Profanity filtering is deliberately limited to the public room; toxicity still
 * applies everywhere. The two scopes share one underlying [MlTextModerator] (wired in the moderation DI
 * module) so the heavy model is loaded at most once.
