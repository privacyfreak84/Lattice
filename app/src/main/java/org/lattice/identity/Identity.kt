/**
 * The device's mesh identity: a 128-bit [nodeId] (used as the mesh advert/endpoint name and the author of
 * messages/profiles) that is the hash of the long-term end-to-end [publicKeyBundle]. Because the
 * nodeId is *derived from* the keypair (see [NodeId.fromPublicKeyBundle]), identity is self-certifying
 * — no peer can claim our nodeId without our private key. The keypair (see [IdentityKeyStore]) is
 * generated once and survives independently of the (destructively-migrated) database, so the nodeId is
 * stable for the life of that keypair.
 *
 * Separately, [deviceTag] is a key-independent, reinstall-surviving device tag used *only* for soft
 * block-list continuity (a blocked peer that regenerates their key returns under a new nodeId but the
 * same tag) — see [DeviceTag]. It is never part of routing, addressing, or trust.
