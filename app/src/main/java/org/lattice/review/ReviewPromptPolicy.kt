/**
 * Pure "should we ask the user to rate the app right now?" decision, mirroring
 * [org.lattice.mesh.bluetooth.ScanDemandPolicy]: no Android, an injected clock, JVM-unit-testable.
 *
 * The prompt targets the *engaged* user — the mesh has visibly worked more than once and they've
 * participated — following the standard "don't ask too early" guidance. All five gates must pass:
 *  1. ≥ [MIN_PEER_MESSAGES] messages received from real peers (`senderId != me`, normal kind);
 *  2. ≥ [MIN_SENT_MESSAGES] messages sent (participation, not just lurking);
 *  3. ≥ [MIN_ENGAGEMENT_AGE_MS] since the first peer message was observed *locally*
 *     ([Inputs.engagementStartedAt] is a local-clock watermark persisted by ReviewPrompter — deliberately
 *     not derived from a message's `sentAt`, which is the sender's skewable clock);
 *  4. fewer than [MAX_ATTEMPTS] lifetime attempts;
 *  5. ≥ [REPROMPT_COOLDOWN_MS] since the last attempt.
 *
 * An "attempt" means we *showed* the prompt — we deliberately don't record which button the user tapped
 * (rate, feedback, or a dismiss), so the policy re-asks only on a long cooldown and caps the total for good.
