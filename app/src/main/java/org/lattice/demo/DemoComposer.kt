/**
 * Debug trailer seam: scripted commands that drive the **real** Nearby composer so the promo trailer shows
 * the local user typing a message and sending it, rather than a bubble simply materializing. The animated
 * [org.lattice.demo.DemoDirector] (debug-only) emits commands; a `BuildConfig.DEMO_DIRECTOR`-gated
 * `LaunchedEffect` in `ChatScreen` collects them, types into the field char-by-char (which fires the real
 * "now typing" cue), then routes through the real send path.
 *
 * Lives in `src/main` (like [org.lattice.ui.share.ShareInbox]) so `ChatScreen` can reference it in
 * every variant; it is completely inert unless something emits, which only the debug director ever does, so
 * it is dead weight R8 strips from release. Registered as a Koin singleton in `AppModule`.
