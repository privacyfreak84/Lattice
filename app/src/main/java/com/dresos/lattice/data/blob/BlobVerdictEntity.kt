/**
 * Cached on-device NSFW verdict for a stored image blob, keyed by the same SHA-256 content [hash] as
 * [BlobEntity] — for an E2E attachment that's the ciphertext hash, with the verdict computed from the
 * *decrypted* pixels. The cache is populated on receive (the send side only screens to gate a
 * confirm/block and caches nothing) and is idempotent per hash, so each stored image is scanned at most
 * once. [flagged] true means the image is explicit and should be blurred behind a tap-to-reveal; [score]
 * is the classifier confidence in `[0, 1]`.
