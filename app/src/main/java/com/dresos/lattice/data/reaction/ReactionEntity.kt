/**
 * One person's reaction to one message, as stored on this device. The composite primary key
 * ([messageId], [reactorNodeId]) enforces "at most one reaction per person per message", so a
 * toggle/replace is a plain upsert.
 *
 * [emoji] null is a retraction *tombstone*, not a deleted row: a null at a newer [updatedAt] must
 * still beat a stale "add" frame that arrives late (last-writer-wins), which a delete couldn't do.
 * The UI stream filters these out (see [ReactionDao.observeAll]).
 *
 * [updatedAt] is the reacting device's wall clock at emit time (the wire [sentAt]); it is the
 * last-writer-wins comparator applied in [ReactionRepository.apply]. There is intentionally no
 * foreign key to `messages`: a reaction can arrive before the message it targets (out-of-order mesh
 * delivery), and must persist as an orphan until that message shows up.
