/**
 * Single source of truth for content-addressed image blobs (attachments + avatars + group photos) held
 * in the encrypted database. Wraps [BlobDao] and owns the cross-table reference check used to
 * garbage-collect an orphaned blob once nothing points at it — including dropping the blob's cached NSFW
 * verdict row ([verdicts]) as part of the same GC transaction. The image *screening* itself (invoking the
 * classifier, caching verdicts) lives in [com.dresos.lattice.moderation.ImageScreeningService]; this class
 * only owns the [verdicts] DAO for verdict-row GC so it can stay atomic with the blob delete.
