/**
 * A stable, app-scoped per-**device** tag used *only* for soft block-list continuity.
 *
 * Since a [nodeId][NodeId] is now the hash of the E2E keypair (self-certifying), a blocked peer that
 * reinstalls/wipes loses their key and returns under a *new* nodeId — which would silently evade a
 * block. To keep blocking sticky, a device advertises this key-independent tag (derived from a stable
 * device id such as `ANDROID_ID`, which survives reinstall/data-clear on the same device + signing
 * key); when a blocked device reappears under a new identity, its tag still matches.
 *
 * This is a **soft deterrent only**: the tag is self-asserted, so a motivated abuser running a
 * modified app can change it. It is never used for routing, addressing, key pinning, or trust — only
 * the local block list. It is salted (not the raw device id) and 64-bit, large enough that collisions
 * (which would wrongly block a bystander) are negligible. Pure/Android-free so it is unit-testable.
