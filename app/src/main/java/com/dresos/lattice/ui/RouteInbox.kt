/**
 * A process-scoped, single-shot handoff for a navigation route arriving from outside Compose — namely a
 * notification tap (deep-link to `chat/<conversationId>`). [com.dresos.lattice.MainActivity] reads the
 * route extra in `onCreate`/`onNewIntent` and [offer]s it here; `KnitApp` observes [pending] and
 * navigates, then [consume]s it. Mirrors [com.dresos.lattice.ui.share.ShareInbox]: a holder is needed
 * because a warm (already-running) instance can't restart at a new NavHost start destination, and a
 * navigation route can't ride Compose state directly from an Activity intent.
