/**
 * A [State] holding the current wall-clock time in epoch millis, refreshed every [intervalMs] while
 * in composition. Read it where a relative-time label ("5m", "2h ago") is rendered so the label
 * recomposes as time passes instead of freezing at the value captured on first composition — a plain
 * `System.currentTimeMillis()` call is not a tracked state read, so Compose never revisits it on its
 * own.
 *
 * The ticker coroutine is scoped to composition, so it stops automatically when the caller leaves the
 * tree. Hoist one of these per screen and pass the value down rather than ticking per row.
