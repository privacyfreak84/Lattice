 * Process-scoped single-shot signal that the rate/review prompt should be shown. [com.dresos.lattice.review]

 * `KnitApp` observes [pending] and shows [RateReviewDialog] over the current screen, then [consume]s it.
 * Mirrors [com.dresos.lattice.ui.RouteInbox] — the prompt is decided outside Compose but must surface at the
 * NavHost root, above whichever screen is showing.
