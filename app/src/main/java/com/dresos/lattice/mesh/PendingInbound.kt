 * dedups); [fromNodeId] is the neighbor we received it from, preserved so the replay re-runs the exact
 * inbound path. [parkedAt] drives the TTL sweep. A plain class (it holds [ByteArray]s, like [CarriedFrame]).

/**
 * Short-lived, bounded, in-memory buffer of inbound frames awaiting their sender's key — the inbound
 * complement of the outbound `pendingKey`/`flushPendingFor` retransmit. When `MeshManager.verifyInbound`
 * drops a frame for a missing sender key it both requests the key ([KeyExchange.want]) and parks the
 * frame here ([hold]); when the key arrives, `MeshManager.handleProfile` re-runs every parked frame for
 * that sender through the normal deliver path ([release]), so a message that raced ahead of its sender's
 * profile still lands instead of being lost.
 *
 * In-memory by design: a parked frame is **unauthenticated** until its key arrives, so persisting
 * attacker-controlled bytes to disk would be a strictly worse abuse vector; the buffer evaporates on
 * restart (where store-and-forward re-serve still covers DM/group anyway). Bounded three ways — a
 * per-sender cap, a global cap (the real bound, since the senderId key is an unauthenticated claim), and
 * a short [holdTtlMs] — all with oldest-first eviction. Pure (no Android/Room; injected clock), so it is
 * JVM-tested directly (see `PendingInboundTest`).
