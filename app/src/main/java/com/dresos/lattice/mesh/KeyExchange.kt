/**
 * Demand-driven recovery of a peer's public key (i.e. its profile) over the mesh. The mesh floods a
 * profile once on connect/edit and relays it under a one-shot, [SeenSet]-deduped id, so a node that
 * joined late — or is simply more than one hop from the originator — can permanently miss it and then
 * drop every frame that peer floods with `NO_SENDER_KEY` (see `MeshManager.verifyInbound`). This closes
 * that gap: a node that drops a frame for a missing key asks its neighbors for it ([want]); a neighbor
 * that holds the peer's profile re-serves it, and one that doesn't recurses the request and forwards the
 * profile on once it arrives ([onRequest] / [onProfilePinned]). The profile therefore walks hop-by-hop
 * to any requester using only direct-neighbor sends — deliberately the same point-to-point recursion as
 * [BlobExchange], NOT another flood, so recovery never re-introduces the flood-timing fragility that
 * caused the gap in the first place.
 *
 * The request is **signed** and `relay = false`: signed so a responder authenticates it against the
 * requester's pinned key (always present — direct neighbors exchange profiles on connect) and can ignore
 * blocked/unknown askers; point-to-point so it never floods (which would also have a verify-bootstrap
 * problem at relays that lack the requester's key). The *response* needs no signing or new type — the
 * peer's cached, originator-signed [FrameType.PROFILE] frame is replayed verbatim ([signed]/[sig]
 * byte-for-byte), and the existing profile path self-certifies it on pin (the nodeId must derive to the
 * advertised key), exactly as content-addressing secures a [BlobExchange] reply.
 *
 * The bookkeeping is keyed by **unauthenticated** senderIds — [want] is called from the `NO_SENDER_KEY`
 * drop path with a not-yet-pinned (so unverified) sender id — so, like [PendingInbound], it is **bounded**:
 * [missing] and [wanters] are capped (oldest-first eviction) and [missing] is TTL-swept ([sweepExpired]);
 * an outbound batch is chunked ([maxIdsPerReq]) so it can never exceed the link's payload ceiling and crash
 * the writer; and an inbound request's id list is capped ([maxRequestIds]) so it can't drive unbounded
 * recursion/growth. A peer flooding forged sender ids therefore costs bounded memory and work.
 *
 * Pure (no Android/Room): the transport, identity, raw signer, and clock are injected, so the recursion
 * is unit-tested with [FakeLoopTransport] (see `KeyExchangeTest`).
