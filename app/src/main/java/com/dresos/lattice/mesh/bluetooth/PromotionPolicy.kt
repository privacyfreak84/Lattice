/**
 * The pure "which nearby peers should we hold a persistent Bluetooth link to?" decision — the BLE analogue of
 * Wi-Fi Aware's `DigestTracker`/sync-wanted logic, but promotion is driven by **dwell + RSSI** (proximity)
 * rather than a data-sync cue, because BLE links are cheap and persistent (no one-NDP cost). Bounded by a
 * connection budget with weakest-first, hysteretic eviction so a dense crowd of transient passers-by can't
 * thrash the link set.
 *
 * Fully pure (the caller supplies all clock-derived durations, like `PowerPolicy`), so it is JVM-unit-testable
 * ([com.dresos.lattice.PromotionPolicyTest]). The caller pre-filters [candidates] to peers it should initiate to
 * (the nodeId tie-break `local > peer`, and not already linked).
