/**
 * An [OutputStream] filter that splits every write into slices no larger than [maxChunk] before handing them
 * to [delegate]. Pure (no Android), so it is JVM-unit-testable
 * ([com.dresos.lattice.SegmentingOutputStreamTest]).
 *
 * It exists for the Bluetooth **L2CAP CoC** socket ([com.dresos.lattice.mesh.bluetooth.BluetoothSocketLink]):
 * each write to that socket becomes one L2CAP SDU, whose length is a **16-bit field (max 65535)**. A single
 * whole [LinkFraming] FILE_CHUNK record is 64 KiB + 5 B = 65541 B — and `BufferedOutputStream` passes any
 * array at least as large as its own buffer **straight through as one write** — so without segmenting, one
 * write emits an SDU over the ceiling. A weaker vendor Bluetooth stack (observed on a Moto G `cherokee`,
 * API 30) underflowed reassembling that oversized SDU, corrupting its heap and aborting the whole
 * `com.android.bluetooth` process. [FramedLink]'s length-prefixed framing reassembles the byte stream
 * irrespective of SDU boundaries, so slicing here is transparent to every layer above.
 *
 * The Wi-Fi Aware NDP path is a plain TCP [java.net.Socket] ([NetSocketLink]) with no such ceiling and is
 * deliberately **not** wrapped.
