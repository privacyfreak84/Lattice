/**
 * The transport-neutral identity handshake over a fresh [LinkSocket], a **two-way** HELLO exchange. The
 * initiator writes its advert as the first [LinkFraming.Type.HELLO] record so an accept-any responder —
 * which accepts a connection without knowing who dialed in — learns the peer; the responder then
 * [replyHello]s its own advert so the **initiator** can confirm it reached the peer it intended (link
 * identity is confirmed over the socket, never taken solely from the unauthenticated discovery advert).
 * Both Wi-Fi Aware (NDP) and Bluetooth (L2CAP) links use it.
 *
 * Ordering is deadlock-free: the initiator writes-then-reads, the responder reads-then-replies, so neither
 * blocks on a read before the other has written. Each side must **bound** its [readHello] blocking read (so
 * a stalled peer can't pin a slot): Wi-Fi Aware sets `socket.soTimeout`, Bluetooth closes the socket from a
 * watchdog (a `BluetoothSocket` has no `soTimeout`).
