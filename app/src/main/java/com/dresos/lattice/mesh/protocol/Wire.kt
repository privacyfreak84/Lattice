 * The wire is layered so the format can evolve additively without ever forcing another break:

 *   re-encodes. It carries the mutable routing counters ([ttl]/[hops]) plus the signature and the
 *   opaque [signed] blob it covers. A relay rewrites only ttl/hops ([WireEnvelope.relayed]); [signed]
 *   and [sig] pass through byte-for-byte, so the originator's exact signed bytes survive every hop.
 * - [RelayEnvelope] (layer 2, what [signed] decodes to) carries only the cleartext fields a relay or
 *   store-and-forward carrier needs to route ([type]/[id]/[senderId]/[recipientId]/[group]) plus an
 *   opaque [payload]. Because relays never re-encode it, new fields can be added here too: an old relay
 *   ignores them on decode ([WireCodec] uses `ignoreUnknownKeys`) yet still forwards the original bytes.
 * - The per-type content (layer 3: [ChatContent], [ProfileContent], …) lives inside [payload] and is
 *   parsed only by endpoints, so it evolves freely — new fields and even new [type] values are invisible
 *   to relays, which forward them verbatim instead of dropping them.
 *
 * The single [sig] over [signed] authenticates every type (the previous split between a frame signature
 * and a separate envelope signature is gone). [type]/[id]/[senderId] ride inside [signed], so a
 * signature cannot be lifted across frames, replayed under a fresh id, or moved between types.
