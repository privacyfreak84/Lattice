/**
 * Transport-agnostic mesh logic: deduplicates incoming frames, delivers new ones locally, and floods
 * them onward bounded by the frame's TTL.
 *
 * Rather than rebroadcasting immediately (blind flooding, which storms a dense cluster with O(n²)
 * redundant sends), a first-seen frame's relay is scheduled after a small random [jitter] delay. If,
 * during that window, the same frame is overheard from enough neighbors ([suppressThreshold]) — i.e.
 * a neighbor already relayed it — the pending relay is cancelled. This counter-based suppression cuts
 * redundant traffic in dense meshes while still relaying reliably in sparse ones (where no duplicate
 * is overheard). Locally-originated frames bypass this and send immediately.
 *
 * Kept free of Android/Room/transport dependencies so it can be unit-tested with a fake transport.
