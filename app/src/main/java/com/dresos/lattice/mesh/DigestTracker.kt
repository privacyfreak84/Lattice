/**
 * Pure anti-entropy decision for the Wi-Fi Aware **cue plane**: tracks each peer's advertised content digest
 * ([StoreDigest.version], learned from its cue) and the version we were both at after our last data-path
 * sync, and answers the one question the connection engine needs — *is a data-path sync with this peer worth
 * bringing up the one scarce NDP right now?*
 *
 * The decisive win over the old counter epoch is the **identical-digest skip**: if a peer's digest already
 * equals ours, our stores match and there is nothing to exchange — so we never waste an NDP, *even on first
 * contact* (e.g. two leaves both fed by the same hub converge to the same version and never sync each other).
 * Otherwise a peer is reconcile-wanted whenever the digests differ and it is not on a no-progress cooldown.
 * Because a content digest is a hash, not an ordered counter, comparisons are **equality** (no
 * monotone-max) — which is what makes it restart-stable: a peer that restarts to the same store re-advertises
 * the same version and correctly reads as "unchanged".
 *
 * ## No-progress throttle
 * Two nodes whose custody policies differ on any frame (per-node `canCarry` gates, DM-recipient exclusion,
 * quota-eviction asymmetry) can complete sync after sync **without ever converging** — and because the digests
 * still differ afterward, the very next round wants the sync again: the re-audit's
 * ~5 s serve loop (`docs/NAN_CONCURRENCY_REAUDIT.md` §3.2), historically damped only by the after-serve
 * reattach's accidental rate-limiting. The throttle bounds it at the decision layer: [THROTTLE_SYNCS]
 * *completed-but-non-convergent* syncs within [THROTTLE_WINDOW_MS] put the peer on an exponential cooldown
 * ([COOLDOWN_INITIAL_MS] doubling to [COOLDOWN_MAX_MS]) during which [reconcileWanted] is false; once engaged,
 * each further non-convergent completion re-arms the (doubled) cooldown immediately. The reset is **observed
 * convergence only** (equal digests, seen by either [onReconciled] or [reconcileWanted]) — deliberately NOT
 * "a digest moved", because in the pathology this exists for, both digests move every round (the §5.3 reset
 * rule as originally proposed would permanently defeat the throttle). Cost: a genuinely-new message to a
 * still-divergent peer waits out ≤ the current cooldown for its *bulk* sync; small frames still arrive
 * instantly via the coordination-plane fast path, and custody re-serves on the next completed sync. A wedge
 * (syncs that never *complete*) never engages the throttle — only [onReconciled] counts — so the wedge
 * watchdog's owed signal is never masked.
 *
 * Only the **initiator** (larger nodeId, by the transport's tie-break) consults [reconcileWanted]; the
 * responder never initiates, so its per-peer state going stale is harmless. Records [onReconciled] on the
 * initiator's clean (quiescence) teardown, at our *post-sync* version. [clock] is injectable for tests
 * (defaulted, so production construction sites and
 * existing tests are unchanged); the transport passes its `SystemClock::elapsedRealtime`. No Android deps ⇒
 * JVM-unit-tested ([DigestTrackerTest]); all methods are guarded for the transport's callback-thread vs.
 * loop-coroutine access.
