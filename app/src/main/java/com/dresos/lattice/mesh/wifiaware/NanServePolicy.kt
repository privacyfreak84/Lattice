/**
 * Pure admission policy for **concurrent inbound serves** on the accept-any responder
 * (`docs/NAN_CONCURRENCY_REAUDIT.md` §5.1, field-proven in E2/P0). An accept consumes no NDI — the standing
 * responder request officially multiplexes NDPs on its single interface — so on multi-NDP hardware the only
 * hard exclusions are the firmware's session budget and an in-flight *initiator* handshake (which genuinely
 * contends for the one NDI: an inbound NDP arriving mid-initiate is refused by the framework and kills the
 * responder request — the `onUnavailable` re-file exists for exactly that). On 1-NDP-budget hardware
 * (Samsung S.LSI ships `maxNdpSessions = 1`) the policy degrades to the legacy single-slot semantics,
 * byte-equivalent to the pre-P1 `beginAccept`. No Android deps ⇒ JVM-unit-tested ([NanServePolicyTest]).
