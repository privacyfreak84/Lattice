/**
 * Pure, JVM-testable feed-pacing for a streamed file over a link — the average byte-rate limiter that keeps a
 * bulk transfer from monopolising a slow, shared channel.
 *
 * [FramedLink.streamFile] already interleaves live frames between file chunks, but on the Bluetooth **L2CAP CoC**
 * plane that interleaving is defeated below the app layer: `BluetoothSocket.getOutputStream().write()` buffers
 * into the local socket → BT-stack TX queue and returns, so the writer dumps a whole small blob into that queue
 * in a burst — a frame enqueued *afterwards* lands behind the entire file and only reaches the wire once it
 * drains ("text arrives only when the transfer completes"), and the saturated ACL starves the reverse direction
 * too. Pacing the file feed to ~link capacity keeps that queue shallow: interleaved frames sit near the wire
 * head and the freed connection-event budget carries reverse traffic.
 *
 * Kept free of Android and of a clock (the caller stamps `elapsedMs` from the link's injected `now`), like
 * [com.dresos.lattice.mesh.bluetooth.ConnectBackoffPolicy], so the curve is asserted with the same unit-test
 * style. The Wi-Fi Aware NDP socket is fast and must not be throttled, so it runs unbounded
 * ([PaceConfig.bytesPerSec] ≤ 0).
