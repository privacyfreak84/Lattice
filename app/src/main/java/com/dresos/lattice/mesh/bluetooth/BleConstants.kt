     * across the break hard-partitions at discovery, exactly like Wi-Fi Aware's `SERVICE_NAME` digit. `0xFE30`
     * is the launch baseline. Still a 16-bit value in the SIG-assigned `0xFE00–0xFEFF` block (not allocated to
     * this app — accepted pre-release risk; a member-assigned UUID would land here).
