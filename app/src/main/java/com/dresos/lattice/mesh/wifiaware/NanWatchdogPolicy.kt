/**
 * Pure decision for the two-tier NAN data-plane **wedge watchdog** (the leaked-request self-heal;
 * `docs/DIGEST_PULL_REATTACH.md`). Extracted from `WifiAwareTransport.checkWedge` so the episode-clock
 * arithmetic — the subtle part, an *owed-episode* measured from when divergence appeared, reset on any
 * progress, NOT time-since-last-link — is exercised on the JVM ([NanWatchdogPolicy]'s test). The transport
 * still owns the two owed signals, the clock, and the side effects (session cycle / process kill); this
 * object only maps them to an [Action] plus the next episode-clock value.
 *
 * Both tiers are measured against the **uncorroborated** [reachableOwed] so they still fire when the
 * corroborating Bluetooth plane is dark; the Tier-2 process kill is additionally gated on the
 * **corroborated** [corroboratedOwed] so an out-of-range-but-still-cueing peer can't self-kill the node.
