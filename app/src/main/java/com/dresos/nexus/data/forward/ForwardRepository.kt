/**
 * [ForwardStore] backed by the encrypted `forward_store` table. Persists carried DM, group, and
 * broadcast-room chat frames as canonical CBOR (signed blob + signature) and enforces the store's bounds
 * so epidemic carry can't grow without limit:
 *
 *  - a per-message **TTL** ([ttlMs] for DMs/groups, the shorter [broadcastTtlMs] for the ambient
 *    broadcast room) after which the sweep reclaims a frame even if never acked (the *only* purge path
 *    for group/broadcast messages — no reliable ack — and the backstop for DMs whose receipt never arrives);
 *  - a **per-sender quota** ([maxPerSender]) so one identity (Sybil is cheap on this mesh) can't fill
 *    the buffer with junk we'd re-offer to everyone;
 *  - a **per-group quota** ([maxPerGroup]) so one busy group can't monopolize the buffer either;
 *  - a **broadcast quota** ([maxBroadcast]) so ambient broadcast chatter can't crowd out addressed messages;
 *  - a **global cap** ([maxRows]) with oldest-first, relayed-before-our-own eviction.
 *
 * Every bound is evaluated over **live** rows only, and the digest folds only live ids — an expired-but-unswept
 * row is per-node state (sweep ticks phase independently), so letting it into any rule would de-converge the
 * carried sets; the sweep is pure storage GC (work item #8).
