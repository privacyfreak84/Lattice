/**
 * A floodable frame this device is carrying for store-and-forward delivery — a DM/group/broadcast-room chat
 * message, or a metadata frame (reaction/receipt/group-update/group-leave/profile). The
 * mesh floods a frame once and forgets it; this table lets a node keep a message and re-offer it to a
 * neighbor that joins later (the DM recipient / a relay toward them, a group member, or anyone for a
 * broadcast) — see `com.dresos.nexus.mesh.ForwardSync`.
 *
 * [id] is the wire frame id (== the dedup key and, for our own sends, the `messages` row id). [signed]
 * is the canonical CBOR of the routing envelope and [sig] its Ed25519 signature — the immutable,
 * re-floodable core. The throwaway routing counters (ttl/hops) live only in the wrapper a carrier stamps
 * fresh on re-serve, so the frame re-floods with a full hop budget. At most one of [recipientId] (the
 * DM's cleartext target) / [groupId] (the group's id) is set; **both null identifies a broadcast-room
 * frame** (offered to every newcomer, TTL/cap-bounded only). [recipientId] lets a carrier push a DM
 * toward that peer and require a delivery receipt to come *from* that peer before purging it; a group
 * has no single recipient (TTL/caps purge only), and the member roster to push toward is read from the
 * decoded envelope ([signed]). [groupId] bounds the per-group quota. [type] is the wire frame type, so the
 * store buckets per-type policy — the broadcast quota + shorter TTL apply only to broadcast-room chat, not the
 * reaction/receipt/profile frames that share its null recipient/group shape. [origin] records whether we
 * relayed a frame for others (`ORIGIN_RELAY`) or authored it (`ORIGIN_SELF`) — diagnostic only, now that quota
 * eviction is origin-agnostic. [sentAt] is the originator's envelope clock (identical on every node), so
 * trimming each over-quota bucket to its newest-N *by [sentAt]* keeps every node's carried set — and hence its
 * content digest — convergent; without it a chatty originator (which used to bypass the quota outright) held
 * frames a capped carrier could never accept, so the digests never matched. [receivedAt] records local arrival
 * (diagnostic + `ForwardDao.liveRows` ordering only). [expiresAt] drives the TTL sweep and is
 * `sentAt + TTL` — **frame-global** like the eviction key, so every node expires the frame at the same instant and
 * the carried set (and hence its content digest) converges; keying it off local arrival let a late joiner re-store
 * a swept frame with a fresh lease so it never died mesh-wide.
 *
 * [attachmentHash] is the content hash of the frame's image blob, denormalized from the decoded
 * [com.dresos.nexus.mesh.protocol.ChatContent] (null for a non-chat frame or a chat with no image). It lets a
 * carrier pull + durably hold the blob (so a custodied image survives to a late joiner) and pins the blob against
 * GC while the frame is carried — see `BlobDao.orphanHashes` / `BlobRepository.deleteIfUnreferenced`. It is
 * deliberately NOT part of the content digest (the digest folds only [id]), so per-node blob bounding can't
 * perturb cue-plane convergence.
