/**
 * A chat message as stored on this device. [id] is the globally-unique wire id (also the dedup key
 * across the mesh). [recipientId] is null for broadcast-room messages and set for 1:1 DMs.
 * [conversationId] groups messages into a thread ([Conversations.NEARBY] for the room, the other
 * party's node id for a DM) and is indexed for the per-thread chat queries. [received] is the
 * delivery-ack flag for messages this device sent (drives the ✓/✓✓ tick).
 *
 * [mentions] is a JSON-encoded `List<Mention>` ("[]" when none); kept as a string so Room stays a
 * plain TEXT column and (de)serialization lives with the [Mention] type via [MentionStore].
 *
 * [attachmentHash]/[attachmentMime] reference an out-of-band image blob fetched by content hash; the
 * bytes live in the encrypted `blobs` table (see [com.dresos.nexus.data.blob.BlobEntity]), keyed by
 * [attachmentHash], and are null until the blob has been pulled from the mesh.
 *
 * [attachmentKey] is the base64 AES key for an end-to-end-encrypted attachment: in a DM/group the blob
 * bytes are ciphertext (content-addressed by their ciphertext hash), so the UI must decrypt them with
 * this key before decoding. Null for plaintext (broadcast-room) attachments and text-only messages.
 *
 * The `replyTo*` columns snapshot the message this one is a quoted reply to (all null when it isn't a
 * reply): [replyToId] the quoted message's id, [replyToAuthorId] its sender's node id (the UI swaps it to
 * "You" when it's the viewer's own), [replyToAuthor] a display-name snapshot, [replyToSnippet] a capped
 * copy of the quoted body (blank for an attachment-only original), and [replyToHasAttachment] whether the
 * original carried an image (so the quote can show a "photo" placeholder). They are denormalized from
 * [com.dresos.nexus.mesh.protocol.ReplyRef] so the quote renders even when the original was never
 * received, was deleted, or scrolled out of history.
 *
 * [moderation] records an on-device content-moderation verdict for the [body] ([MODERATION_NONE] or
 * [MODERATION_TEXT_FLAGGED]). A flagged inbound message is still stored, but the UI collapses it behind
 * a tap-to-reveal rather than dropping it (so a false positive never loses content).
 *
 * [pendingKey] marks an outgoing DM that was saved locally but could not yet be sealed/flooded because
 * the recipient's public key wasn't known (distinct from [received], which can't tell "never sent" from
 * "sent, awaiting ack"). It stays true until the recipient's profile arrives and `MeshManager` re-seals
 * and floods it (see `flushPendingFor`). Always false for received messages and broadcast/group sends.
 *
 * [kind] discriminates an ordinary chat message ([KIND_NORMAL]) from a locally-generated status notice
 * ([KIND_MEMBER_LEFT], rendered as a centered "X left the chat" line rather than a bubble). A status row
 * has an empty [body] and its [senderId] is the subject of the event (the member who left).
