/**
 * Computes the square region of a source bitmap that falls inside a centered circular crop window,
 * given the user's pinch [scale] and drag [offsetX]/[offsetY] as produced by a Compose
 * `transformable` + `graphicsLayer` (center transform origin; translation in viewport pixels,
 * unscaled — the same convention as `FullscreenImageViewer` in chat).
 *
 * Both the image and the crop window are centered, so the viewport size cancels out and is not an
 * input. At [scale] == 1 with no offset this reproduces a plain center-crop. Because [scale] >= 1,
 * the square always fits inside the source, so the result is only ever *shifted* back in-bounds
 * (never shrunk) — keeping it square so the later scale-to-256² introduces no distortion.
 *
 * Pure float/int math with no Android types, so it is directly unit-testable.
