/**
 * Outcome of moderating a chat message body. [allowed] false means the text should be blocked (on
 * send) or collapsed behind a tap-to-reveal (on receive). [score] is the classifier confidence in
 * `[0, 1]` (1 for a deterministic lexical hit) — for the ML pass it is the highest score among the
 * enforced toxicity categories, reported even when it stayed below threshold (i.e. [allowed] true) so
 * debug logs show near-misses rather than a flat 0. [category] records the coarse class that tripped
 * it; [label] is the specific underlying classifier label when known (e.g. `"sexual_explicit"`), null
 * for a lexical/profanity hit or when no model is bundled.
