/**
 * On-device image-moderation service: screens images against [imageModerator] and caches the NSFW verdict
 * by content hash in [verdicts]. Extracted from `BlobRepository` so the data layer no longer invokes the
 * classifier (`docs/ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md` #16). Screening always runs; the content-filtering setting only
 * gates receive-side *hiding* (the chat blur and the avatar-adoption decision), not the scan.
 *
 * The send side screens to gate a confirm/block ([isImageExplicit], cached nowhere); the receive side caches
 * the verdict for a stored blob ([screenImage]) so each received image is scanned at most once. For an E2E
 * attachment the stored bytes are ciphertext, so the caller decrypts first and passes the plaintext to
 * [screenImage] under the ciphertext hash (see `InboundPipeline.screenEncryptedAttachment`).
