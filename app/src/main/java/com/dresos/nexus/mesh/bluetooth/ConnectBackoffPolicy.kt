/**
 * Pure, JVM-testable escalating backoff for repeated Bluetooth L2CAP connect failures to one peer.
 *
 * [BluetoothMeshTransport] re-drives promotions on a fixed tick, so a peer that keeps failing to link —
 * radio busy (e.g. A2DP audio streaming to a speaker, the reported case) or simply unreachable — would
 * otherwise be re-attempted at a flat cadence forever, and *every* doomed attempt blacks out BLE scanning
 * while it sits in flight. This grows the per-peer retry gap geometrically (base, 2×, 4×, … capped) with
 * jitter, so the churn dies down while the radio is saturated yet still recovers promptly once it frees; the
 * transport resets a peer's streak the moment a link comes up.
 *
 * Kept free of Android and of a clock (the caller stamps the deadline), like [PromotionPolicy] and
 * [BlePresenceTracker], so the curve is asserted with the same unit-test style.
