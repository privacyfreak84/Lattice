/**
 * A **content digest** of the carried-message set — an order-independent 64-bit fingerprint of the **live**
 * (non-expired) ids in the [ForwardStore]. The Wi-Fi Aware **cue plane** (`WifiAwareTransport`) advertises the
 * digest over the tiny no-data-path message channel so a neighbor can decide, *without* bringing up a scarce
 * NAN data path, whether a sync is worth it — two nodes whose carried set matches produce the **same** version
 * and skip the data path.
 *
 * Replaces the old monotone `SyncEpoch` counter. Two wins from being content-derived rather than a counter:
 *  - **no no-op syncs** — the version only differs when the carried *set* differs, so an already-matching pair
 *    never wastes an NDP (the scarcest resource here — see `docs/DIGEST_PULL_REATTACH.md`);
 *  - **restart-stable** — the same store after a restart yields the same version, so a peer that watermarked
 *    us before the restart doesn't miss us (the old session-local counter reset to 0 and could be ignored by
 *    a peer's monotone-max until it climbed back).
 *
 * Covers **every live id in the carried set** — all custodied frame types (chat, reaction, receipt, group-update/
 * leave, and profiles), since general custody (commit `b277e06`) put them all in `forward_store`. Profiles
 * converge despite being per-node because custody is **symmetric**: each node holds its own profile
 * (`ORIGIN_SELF`) *and* every peer's (`ORIGIN_RELAY`), so once profiles have propagated the whole mesh shares
 * one id set and the "identical ⇒ skip" comparison still holds.
 *
 * ## Live-only membership + the lazy expiry fold
 * The digest folds only ids whose frame-global expiry (`sentAt + TTL`, see `ForwardEntity.expiresAt`) hasn't
 * passed — matching what a sync can actually exchange (`ForwardDao.liveIds`). Folding over *all* rows made
 * every TTL boundary a divergence window: an expired-but-unswept row inflated one node's digest until its
 * 10-minute sweep tick, and sweeps phase independently per node, so peers churned sync-wanted on residue a
 * sync can never reconcile (work item #8). Because `expiresAt` derives from the originator's signed `sentAt`,
 * every node now flips the same id out at the same absolute instant (modulo clock skew) — the sweep is pure
 * storage GC and digest-neutral by construction.
 *
 * Expiry is a function of *time*, which a [StateFlow] can't observe on its own, so the fold is **lazy**:
 * [current] folds newly-expired ids out (batched into one version change), updates [version], and returns the
 * fresh value. **Every read that feeds a decision or an advertisement must go through [current]** — the
 * transports' sync gates, cue/SSI/BLE-advert encoders, and `DigestTracker.onReconciled` recording — never raw
 * `version.value` (which may predate a boundary). [version] remains the *push* channel: the fold's single
 * update fires the existing digest-change collectors (re-cue, SSI republish, BLE re-advertise), and the 30 s
 * cue heartbeat (whose `cueAll` reads [current]) bounds staleness on an otherwise-idle node — no expiry timer,
 * so Doze can defer nothing. See `docs/DIGEST_PULL_REATTACH.md` A1.
 *
 * The fingerprint is XOR of `hash64(id)` over every live held id: order-independent and its own inverse, so
 * add/remove is O(1) ([add]/[remove]) and the lazy fold is O(newly-expired). [setMessages] rebuilds it
 * wholesale (init, sweep, cap-eviction). Owned as a DI singleton — the store impl maintains it and the
 * transports read it — so neither constructs the other. All mutators are `@Synchronized` (store writes on an
 * IO dispatcher; the transports read on their callback threads). [clock] is injectable for tests and must be
 * **wall-clock** (`sentAt` is the originator's wall clock, so expiry comparisons cross node boundaries).
