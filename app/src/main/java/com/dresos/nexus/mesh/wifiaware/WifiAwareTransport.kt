/**
 * [MeshTransport] over **Wi-Fi Aware (NAN)** — a direct `android.net.wifi.aware.*` implementation confined
 * to this package so the rest of the app stays transport-independent (talks only to [MeshTransport]).
 *
 * ## Why cue-driven ephemeral sync
 * Real phones expose **one** NAN data interface (`maxNdiInterfaces == 1`), so a node can hold a data path
 * (NDP) to exactly **one** peer at a time — a second data path to a different peer is refused by the
 * framework ("no interfaces available"). We therefore split into two planes:
 *
 * - **Coordination plane** — Wi-Fi Aware *messages* ([DiscoverySession.sendMessage], ~255 B, best-effort)
 *   which ride discovery follow-up frames and need **no data path**. They reach every discovered neighbor
 *   at once and keep working even while the one NDP is busy. Each node advertises a tiny **cue**
 *   (`nodeId|version`, see [StoreDigest]) so a neighbor can tell when its carried set differs from ours.
 * - **Data plane** — a single ephemeral NDP TCP socket (link-local IPv6, framed by [FramedLink]) brought
 *   up **on demand** only to sync, then torn down, freeing the NDI for the next pair.
 *
 * ## Sync lifecycle
 * A node listens (publish + its accept-any responder up, NDI free) and exchanges cues. When [DigestTracker]
 * says a peer's digest differs from ours (and isn't already reconciled), the **larger** nodeId (the tie-break)
 * brings up one NDP to it; on link-up the upstream `onNeighborAdded` backfill drains the carried
 * store-and-forward / key / blob state both ways. When the link goes quiescent (no data for
 * [QUIESCENCE_MS], no file mid-transfer) the initiator tears it down and records the sync — so an idle mesh
 * does *zero* data-path work, and a new message triggers a targeted sync with only the peers that need it.
 * Everything is delay-tolerant (custody carries what one flood doesn't reach), so a rotating series of
 * pairwise syncs propagates epidemically.
 *
 * The accept-any responder is anchored to the *publish* session (accepts a data path from **any**
 * initiator, learning who via the first HELLO record — see [LinkHandshake]); only *subscribe* is ever
 * re-armed (to re-fire one-shot discovery while idle), never while a live NDP is up.
 *
 * Permissions are gated by onboarding; the mesh starts regardless and degrades if a permission/hardware is
 * missing, so the Aware calls are marked [SuppressLint] for "MissingPermission".

     * this catches any residual/unknown path. The signature is **a sync owed continuously for [WEDGE_RESTART_MS]
     * with no data-path link forming in that whole window**, while Aware is healthy. It is measured as an
     * *owed-episode* ([syncOwedSince]), NOT as time-since-last-link: an idle, converged mesh does zero data-path
     * work for long stretches, so the moment a fresh message makes a sync owed, "no link in N minutes" would be
     * instantly (and wrongly) true — which killed the app the instant the user sent a message. The episode clock
     * starts when divergence appears and **resets on any link** (progress) or on convergence, so a restart only
     * happens when the mesh genuinely cannot sync for the full window. `reattach()` cannot clear this wedge (the
     * orphaned callback ref is lost, so it is never unregistered), so the only proven cure is **process death**;
     * MeshService is `START_STICKY`, so the foreground service is recreated. Rate-limited so it can't restart-storm.
     *
     * P2 demotion: with the ghost-proof recycle + the flap-handshake session cycle in front of it, this should
     * ~never fire — it remains the true last resort for a framework cache ghosted while another aware client
     * holds NAN up (no flap possible). Under P1 concurrency an inbound accept also stamps [lastLinkOrAcceptAt],
     * which is correct: a real ghost blocks accepts too, so genuine wedges still trip it, while an
     * initiator-only pin is now a managed state ([responderPinsNdi]) with its own recovery, not a wedge.
     *
     * **Two tiers** (the owed-episode is measured on the *uncorroborated* [anyReachableSyncOwed] so both tiers
     * work when the corroborating Bluetooth plane is itself dark):
     * - **Tier 1 (light, [RESPONDER_REFRESH_MS]):** a sync owed with no link for the window → refresh a
     *   possibly-wedged responder via [sessionCycleWithSettle]. This is the smallest node's self-heal — it is
     *   everyone's pure responder and never recycles (recycle needs an owed *initiate* it never has), so a
     *   responder that goes stuck after serving-then-idle would otherwise stay dead until process death
     *   (field-observed 2026-07-04). The session cycle is safe at 0 NDPs (the NAN-down wipe clears any ghost an
     *   in-place unregister would mint) and cheap, so it needs no corroboration.
     * - **Tier 2 (last resort, [WEDGE_RESTART_MS]):** still owed *and* [anySyncOwed] (corroborated) → process
     *   kill. Corroboration stays on the kill so an out-of-range-but-cueing peer can't self-kill the node.
