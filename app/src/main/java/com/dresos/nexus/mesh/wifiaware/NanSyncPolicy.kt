/**
 * Pure "is a NAN sync owed?" decisions, extracted from `WifiAwareTransport`'s family of near-duplicate
 * `cueTarget.keys.any { … }` folds. The transport reduces each cue-target candidate to an immutable
 * [PeerFacts] under its own locks and clock reads (see `WifiAwareTransport.snapshotPeerFacts`), so every
 * method here is a pure boolean fold — JVM-tested ([NanSyncPolicy]'s test), zero Android deps.
 *
 * The load-bearing invariant this object makes structural (and testable): the **recovery/watchdog** sites
 * read the **digest-pure** gate ([PeerFacts.digestWanted] / [PeerFacts.reachableSyncOwed]), while the
 * **admission/teardown** sites read the **bulk-aware** [PeerFacts.syncWanted]. A pending bulk (attachment)
 * transfer — whose bytes the BLE fallback still carries — must raise an *initiate* but must never run the
 * wedge clock or churn subscribe re-arm. [digestWanted] and [bulkWanted] are carried as sibling fields so
 * that split can't silently collapse.
