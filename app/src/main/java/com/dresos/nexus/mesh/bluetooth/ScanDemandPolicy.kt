/**
 * Pure "should the BLE scan run **Boosted** or **Floored** this iteration?" decision, mirroring
 * [PromotionPolicy] / [ConnectBackoffPolicy]: no Android, an injected clock, JVM-unit-testable.
 *
 * Boost when there is promotion work — a BLE-sighted-but-unlinked candidate, or a foreign-reachable
 * (other-plane, e.g. Wi-Fi Aware) peer we're still *chasing* onto BLE within its per-peer window — or the
 * node is isolated (0 links → keep the aggressive lonely-rejoin cadence). Floor (the energy saver) only once
 * at least one link is held and nothing is pending, so a settled clique stops scanning back-to-back.
 *
 * The chase deadlines bound the NAN early-warning: a peer another plane can see is worth boosting the scan
 * for *briefly* (it may be about to walk into BLE range), but a stationary NAN-only / out-of-BLE-range peer
 * must not pin Boost forever — so each foreign peer gets a `now + chaseMs` deadline, kept while it stays in
 * the set and re-armed only when it leaves and returns.
