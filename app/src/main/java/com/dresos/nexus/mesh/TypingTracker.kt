/**
 * Receiver-side state for the best-effort "now typing" indicator: which senders are currently typing in which
 * conversation, exposed as a [StateFlow] the chat UI observes. Purely in-memory and self-expiring — a typing
 * [com.dresos.nexus.mesh.protocol.FrameType.TYPING] cue is fire-and-forget and never custodied, so nothing here
 * is persisted or survives a restart (a live typer simply re-cues within [ttlMs]).
 *
 * Two events drive it: [onTyping] when a typing frame arrives (show + arm a [ttlMs] auto-clear, since a sender
 * that stops typing sends no "stopped" frame), and [onMessageFrom] when a real message from that sender lands
 * (clear immediately — the message replaces the indicator). Each entry's auto-clear is a lone delayed coroutine
 * guarded by a monotonic token so a stale removal (superseded by a refresh, or pre-empted by an arriving
 * message) no-ops instead of clobbering fresh state — no per-entry [kotlinx.coroutines.Job] bookkeeping or
 * cancellation races. Pure (only a [CoroutineScope] + a TTL injected, no Android deps) ⇒ unit-tested on the JVM
 * with virtual time (see `TypingTrackerTest`), like [AckSync]/[KeyExchange].
