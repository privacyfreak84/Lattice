/**
 * Demand-driven, content-addressed image fetch over the mesh. A node that needs a blob it lacks asks
 * its direct neighbors ([want]); a neighbor that holds it serves it back over the file channel, and
 * one that doesn't recurses the request and forwards the bytes on once obtained ([onRequest] /
 * [onReceived]). The blob therefore walks hop-by-hop to any requester using only direct-neighbor file
 * transfer — no file-relay-by-destination is needed.
 *
 * The `blobreq` that drives [onRequest] is **unsigned** (see `MeshManager.verifyInbound`), so, like
 * [KeyExchange]/[PendingInbound], the bookkeeping is **bounded**: [fetching] and [wanters] are capped
 * (oldest-first eviction) and [fetching] is TTL-swept ([sweepExpired]); the [recentlyServed] serve-memo
 * keeps its 45 s TTL plus a size cap. A peer flooding requests for hashes we don't hold therefore costs
 * bounded memory and work.
 *
 * Pure (no Android/Room): the transport, blob storage, and identity are injected, so the recursion
 * can be unit-tested with [FakeLoopTransport] and a fake [BlobStore].
