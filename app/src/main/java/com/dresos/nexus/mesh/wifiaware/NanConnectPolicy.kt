/**
 * Pure, JVM-testable policy for how the NAN **initiator** reacts to a failed data-path handshake — the fix for
 * the discover→initiate→fast-fail→re-arm rediscovery livelock (docs/NAN_CONCURRENCY_REAUDIT.md; field-drilled
 * on 3 Pixels 2026-07-04). Kept Android-free like [NanServePolicy] so the curve/threshold are unit-asserted.
 *
 * A **fast** `onUnavailable` (well under the handshake timeout — see [WifiAwareTransport.FAST_FAIL_MS]) is
 * ambiguous: it is the signature of BOTH a genuinely stale subscribe handle (the peer restarted, so
 * re-discovering for a fresh handle is the cure) AND a peer whose responder is wedged or busy on its one NDI
 * (our handle is fine — re-discovering just yields an identical handle that fast-fails the same way, and the
 * repeated subscribe re-arm it drives is itself a wedge trigger on these chipsets). The two are
 * indistinguishable at the instant of failure, so this policy discriminates **behaviorally**, by the
 * consecutive-fast-fail streak:
 *
 * - The **first** fast-fail ([dropHandleOnFastFail] true) is treated as a stale handle → drop it + let
 *   `needsRediscovery` re-arm subscribe. The restart drill (single initiator, 8/8 genuine restarts) showed this
 *   is correct *and* sufficient: a real restart links on the fresh handle first-try, so the streak tops out at 1.
 * - A **second+ consecutive** fast-fail means the *fresh* handle also failed → the fault is the peer's
 *   responder, not our handle. Keep the handle (which suppresses the re-arm, since `needsRediscovery` only
 *   fires for peers *absent* from `discovered`) and let the escalating [backoffMs] + peer-side recovery
 *   (its responder self-heal / freed contention) clear it. Provably safe: a benign restart never reaches 2.
 *
 * Backoff escalates geometrically from a **short** base — the drill showed a flat 10 s base needlessly added
 * ~10 s to every genuine reconnection (the fresh MATCH lands in a few seconds, but the initiate waited out the
 * backoff) — doubling to a cap so a durably-unlinkable peer polls at a low rate instead of churning, spread
 * with jitter so two initiators contending for one responder (the larger-id peers P and Q both initiating to R)
 * don't retry it in lockstep.
