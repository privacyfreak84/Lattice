/**
 * Whether [env] should *also* ride the [MeshTransport.fastFanout] coordination-plane fast path — a
 * best-effort fan-out to every neighbor at once with **no data path** — on top of the normal flood and
 * store-and-forward custody. It's for small, flood-to-everyone frames: the plaintext broadcast room plus the
 * cleartext metadata frames (reactions, delivery receipts, group roster updates/leaves, profiles) — exactly
 * the non-chat [FrameType.isCustodial] types. In an idle cue-driven mesh no NDP is up, so a plain flood
 * reaches the ≤1 live neighbor (usually zero); the fast path delivers to every neighbor at once and custody
 * backstops any peer that was away. Reused on both origination (`originateSigned`) and relay (`onDeliver`),
 * so a frame hops the mesh at message-plane speed rather than only one hop from the originator. E2E DM/group
 * *chat* frames are excluded (the broadcast-only arm): they carry wrapped keys and won't fit the ~255 B
 * channel, so they ride the NDP flood + custody. The transport still size-gates (no-op if a frame won't
 * fit), and the receiver's SeenSet dedups any copy that also arrives over the flood/custody backstop.
