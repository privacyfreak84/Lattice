 * A blob's content address is the lowercase-hex SHA-256 of its bytes — exactly 64 hex characters.

 * Frames and file-transfer headers carry this address as an *untrusted, peer-supplied* string, and it
 * is interpolated into filesystem paths (the staging file, the transfer temp file). Validating
 * the shape before it touches a path stops a malicious neighbor's `../` from escaping the cache /
 * transfer directory, and recomputing it over the received bytes ([sha256Hex]) stops a holder from
 * serving arbitrary bytes under someone else's address (content-address / cache poisoning).
