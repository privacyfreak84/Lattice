# Distribution: Google Play and F-Droid

Two channels, two signing identities, one reproducibility contract. Read this before touching release
signing, `packaging`/`ndk` config, Git LFS, or anything that changes release-APK bytes.

## The two channels

| | Google Play | F-Droid |
|---|---|---|
| Artifact | AAB (`bundleRelease`) | universal APK (`assembleRelease`) |
| Built by | us | **F-Droid's buildserver, from source** — then byte-compared against ours |
| Shipped bytes | Google's (Play App Signing re-signs) | **ours**, verbatim |
| Key | `knit-upload.jks` (upload key only) | `knit-dist.jks` (distribution key) |
| Native symbols | yes, `-Pknit.nativeSymbols=true` | no |

Play App Signing means the Play-installed app carries a certificate we do not hold, so a Play install and
an F-Droid install can never share a signature. That is unavoidable and fine — but it makes the *off-Play*
signature worth protecting, because one distribution-key-signed APK serves GitHub Releases, F-Droid,
direct sideload, **and Knit's own offline app-share** (`ui/invite/ShareApk.kt`). A phone handed Knit over
the mesh can still take an in-place update from F-Droid. That property is the whole reason we use
F-Droid's `Binaries:` + `AllowedAPKSigningKeys` flow instead of letting F-Droid sign with its own key.

`AllowedAPKSigningKeys` pins the distribution certificate publicly in fdroiddata, so **rotating
`knit-dist.jks` forces every off-Play user to uninstall and reinstall.** Treat it as permanent.

## The reproducibility contract

F-Droid rebuilds the tagged commit on their buildserver and byte-compares against the APK on our GitHub
Release. Anything that makes the output a function of *the build machine* breaks it.

**Verified end-to-end for 2.2.0 (2026-07-21).** A fully clean build (52/52 tasks, no cache) inside
`registry.gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver:buildserver`, invoked the way fdroidserver does it
(`cd app && gradle assembleRelease` via F-Droid's `gradlew-fdroid` shim), produced an APK byte-identical
to the host build: `sha256 ec688988f95493c8f662d42a058f20741c1c700e64c9e099d76b1dd8b798366f`. Different
machine, different Android SDK install, F-Droid's own Gradle distribution, fresh Maven downloads, and no
`.git` present. AGP already normalizes zip entry timestamps to `1981-01-01`, and R8, resource shrinking,
and baseline-profile generation all proved deterministic.

Notes on that image: **Debian 13 (trixie), JDK 21 is the default**, `git-lfs` is **not** installed (hence
the LFS ban below), and the `fdroid` CLI is absent — it is the build environment, not the tooling.

## Running the real `fdroid build` locally

`fdroid build` needs no merge request and no GitLab account. It also verified byte-identical output
(`ec688988…`, same hash as above) *after* fdroidserver applied its own source rewrites, which is the
result that actually matters for `Binaries:`. Recipe, in the buildserver image:

1. `apt-get install -y fdroidserver` (2.4.2 in trixie), then **overwrite
   `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/gradlew-fdroid` with `/usr/local/bin/gradle`**. The Debian package
   ships an old *shell* shim with a hardcoded hash table that stops well before Gradle 9.5 and dies with
   `No hash for gradle version 9.5.0`; the image's *Python* shim fetches the live transparency log. This
   is a packaging skew, not an F-Droid limitation.
2. `git config --global --add safe.directory '*'` — the container is root and the source mount is not;
   without it the clone fails with a bare `Git clone failed`.
3. `fdroid init` in a work dir, **then `git init` + commit the metadata**. `fdroid build` derives
   `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` from the app checkout and falls back to *the metadata repo's* git log; with no git
   there it crashes in fdroidserver itself (`TypeError: str expected, not NoneType`). Real fdroiddata is a
   git repo, so this only bites local testing.
4. Point `Repo:` at the local checkout and `commit:` at a SHA to test unpushed/untagged work.
5. `fdroid build <appid>:<vercode> -v -t --scan-binary` (local is the default; `--server` opts into the VM).

What fdroidserver does to the source before building — all confirmed harmless here, but worth knowing:
strips the entire `signingConfigs` block and every `signingConfig =` line from `build.gradle.kts`, removes
debuggable flags, writes `local.properties`, and **deletes `gradlew`, `gradlew.bat` and
`gradle-wrapper.jar`** so its own shim is always used. Our output is unaffected because the signing config
is credential-conditional and contributes nothing without creds — keep it that way.

Also verified: `fdroid scanner` reports **0 problems** (the ~32 MB `.tflite` blobs are not flagged), the
dexdump non-free-class scan and extra-signing-block scan are clean, and `UpdateCheckData` correctly reads
`knit.versionCode`/`knit.versionName` out of `gradle.properties`. `Categories` are validated against
fdroiddata's `config/categories.yml` (108 entries) — a bare local repo has no category config, so
`fdroid lint` will call *every* category invalid there; that is a local artifact, not a real failure.

Four inputs were deliberately de-machine-ified to keep it that way:

- **No VCS stamping.** `buildTypes.release { vcsInfo { include = false } }`. AGP otherwise writes
  `META-INF/version-control-info.textproto` holding the local checkout's HEAD revision — or
  `generate_error_reason: NO_SUPPORTED_VCS_FOUND` when built outside a Git work tree. This was the **only**
  difference (1 entry out of 185, identical APK size) between a host build and a rebuild of the same source
  inside `registry.gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver:buildserver`, and it alone would fail verification.

- **No NDK on the APK path.** `ndkVersion` and `ndk { debugSymbolLevel }` are gated behind
  `-Pknit.nativeSymbols=true` (the Play `bundleRelease` invocation only). AGP's strip step degrades
  *silently* when the NDK is absent, which would mean "stripped here, unstripped there". Instead
  `packaging { jniLibs { keepDebugSymbols += "**/*.so" } }` opts out of stripping explicitly on every
  machine. Measured cost: **+8 bytes** — every shipped `.so` is a third-party release build that upstream
  already stripped, so the strip step was always a no-op.
- **Prebuilt `.so` are shipped verbatim, never stripped.** As of 2.2.2 the APK carries CameraX's
  `libimage_processing_util_jni.so` + `libsurface_util_jni.so` (four ABIs, ~165 KB total) alongside the
  existing LiteRT / SQLCipher / datastore / graphics-path natives — added when the QR scanner moved to
  CameraX (ADR 015). They need no special handling: `packaging { jniLibs { keepDebugSymbols += "**/*.so" } }`
  already opts every `.so` out of stripping, so the packaged bytes are identical with or without an NDK.
  Verified on the 2.2.2 release APK — each `.so` is byte-for-byte the size in the upstream AAR, entry
  timestamps normalized to `1981-01-01`, and all four ABIs present (which the release workflow also checks).
  Any *new* native dependency must additionally be **16 KB-page-aligned** (`readelf -lW` → `LOAD
  align=0x4000`); that requirement is why litert is pinned to 1.4.x and it was re-verified for CameraX.
- **No JDK auto-download.** The `foojay-resolver-convention` plugin is deliberately absent from
  `settings.gradle.kts`, and the `toolchainUrl.*` lines are stripped from
  `gradle/gradle-daemon-jvm.properties`. Both would fetch an unpinned JDK from api.foojay.io. Gradle now
  fails loudly instead, and the builder installs JDK 21 (the recipe's `sudo:` block does this).
  `./gradlew updateDaemonJvm` regenerates those URLs — delete them again if you run it.
- **No Git LFS.** See below.

`dependencyLocking { lockAllConfigurations() }` + `app/gradle.lockfile` is an asset here: it pins every
resolved dependency version, so F-Droid's rebuild resolves exactly what we did.

## Git LFS is banned in this repo

`*.tflite` used to be tracked in Git LFS. It is not, and must not be again. F-Droid's buildserver has no
LFS support ([fdroidserver#1190](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/-/issues/1190), open since 2024),
so a checkout there yields ~130-byte pointer stubs — and `NsfwImageModerator`/`MlTextModerator` both
degrade to allow-all on an unreadable model *by design*. The build would succeed and ship a quietly
unmoderated app that also fails byte-comparison. The `checkModerationModels` task
(`app/build.gradle.kts`, wired into `preBuild`) hard-fails on a stub or a sub-1 MB model so this can never
regress silently.

## The F-Droid source scanner flags TensorFlow Lite — and the from-source replacement is broken

F-Droid's source scanner (fdroidserver **master**, which its CI runs — not the older Debian package or a
tagged release, whose scanner is *not* version-catalog-aware and won't reproduce this) resolves the
`libs.litert` version-catalog alias to `com.google.ai.edge.litert:litert` and flags it as a prebuilt
Google-Maven "usual suspect" (`suss` signature `com.google.ai.edge.litert:litert:(2|1.[34])`), which
**hard-fails `fdroid build`**. The obvious fix — the from-source `de.schliweb:tensorflow-lite-fdroid`
(what `org.fairscan.app` uses) — was tried on-device and **REJECTED**: its from-source TFLite 2.18.0
miscomputes our Detoxify/ALBERT model, saturating every output to a binary `0`/`1` (clean text scores
`1.0` on `severe_toxicity`) so it would block every message. Verified delegate-independent (identical with
XNNPACK on, off, and single-thread); Google's litert scores correctly (`0.00004` clean, `0.957` for real
abuse). It is a fundamental op-level miscompute, not a config knob — `fairscan`'s OCR model happens to
work, ours doesn't. So Knit keeps Google's litert and takes the F-Droid exception:

- **`AntiFeatures: NonFreeDep`** in fdroiddata — litert is Apache-2.0 but ships as a prebuilt binary
  F-Droid can't rebuild.
- **`scanignore` removed — `(2|1.[34])` is an over-broad false positive on the published 1.x line, and the
  fix is upstream.** We first suppressed the flag with `scanignore: [app/build.gradle.kts]`; reviewer linsui
  asked us to drop it (MR 43609), which leaves the build red on the scanner. The catch: the *published*
  `litert:1.3.x`/`1.4.x` AAR (byte-checked from `dl.google.com/android/maven2`) is just the plain
  `org.tensorflow.lite` interpreter — the rebranded classic TFLite, 12 classes, Apache-2.0, **zero
  `com.google.android.play` refs**. The `litert/kotlin/BUILD` target that *does* carry the Play coupling
  (`AiPackModelProvider` + `com.google.android.play:ai-delivery`, added in 1.3.0) is real in the source
  tree, but a git tag snapshots the whole monorepo including that in-progress Kotlin API — it publishes as
  **`litert-api:2.x`**, never as `litert:1.3/1.4.x`. The coupling reaches litert only at 2.x, transitively:
  `litert:2.x → litert-api:2.x → ai-delivery`. So `(2|1.[34])` both over-flags the interpreter line *and*
  misses the real carrier `litert-api:2`. Fix submitted as **`fdroid/fdroid-suss!63`** (signature →
  `litert(-api)?:2`: drop `1.[34]`, add the `litert-api` arm); one-line YAML change, CI green
  (test/validate/lint/black), linsui accepted the finding ("Good catch"), pending merge. Once suss.json
  regenerates our pinned `litert:1.4.2` stops matching and **43609 goes green with no `scanignore`**. (Even
  without the fix the shipped APK is clean: we call only `org.tensorflow.lite.Interpreter` and R8 strips the
  rest, so the release dex has zero Play classes regardless.)
- **`commit:` is the full 40-char hash**, not the `v2.2.1` tag (linsui's request — tags are mutable). No
  `sudo:` block either: the buildserver already has JDK 21 selected, so the manual install was redundant.
- **`AutoUpdateMode: Version`** (bare, not `Version v%v`). Under `UpdateCheckMode: Tags` the metadata
  schema forbids a format string (`^(None|Version( \+.+)?)$`); `Version v%v` is an `UpdateCheckMode: HTTP`
  construct and fails `check-jsonschema`. The tag itself is the version source.

None of this touches the app or the released APK — the moderation model already runs correctly on Google's
litert, so the APK ships unchanged and stays byte-reproducible. This is purely a metadata accommodation. **If
litert is ever bumped, do not move to `2.x`** — it renames the lib and pulls the ai-delivery graph — and
re-verify any TFLite runtime change on-device against `ToxicityInstrumentedTest` (the moderators degrade
silently to allow-all / block-all on a bad interpreter).

## Cutting an off-Play release

`.github/workflows/release.yml` does it: push a `v*` tag and it builds, signs, verifies and drafts the
GitHub Release. Prepare the commit first —

1. Bump `knit.versionCode` / `knit.versionName` in `gradle.properties`. **Keep the tag equal to
   `v<versionName>`** — fdroiddata's `Binaries:` URL expands `%v` to the *versionName*, so a `2.1` /
   `v2.1.0` mismatch breaks the binary lookup. (`AutoUpdateMode` is bare `Version` under `UpdateCheckMode:
   Tags` — see the F-Droid-scanner section below for why `Version v%v` is wrong there.)
2. Update `CurrentVersion` / `CurrentVersionCode` and add a `Builds:` entry in `.fdroid.yml` (then copy it
   to fdroiddata), and add `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs/<versionCode>.txt` — F-Droid scrapes
   `fastlane/metadata/` straight from this repo at the built commit (descriptions, screenshots, changelog).
3. Tag `v<versionName>` and push it. The `preflight` job re-checks every one of the above and refuses the
   release if any disagrees, so a mistake costs a re-tag, not a bad artifact.

The workflow ends at a **draft** Release: the `Binaries:` URL stays 404 until you click publish, which is
the right state while fdroiddata still points at the previous version. Drop `--draft` to go straight out.

**GitHub Actions runs the copy of the workflow that exists at the tag**, so editing `release.yml` only
affects tags cut afterwards. Fixing a workflow bug for an already-created tag means moving the tag.

Required repo secrets (four; the job that reads them declares `environment: release`, so you can attach
required-reviewer or tag-only protection rules to exactly that job):

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `KNIT_DIST_KEYSTORE_B64` | `base64 -w0 knit-dist.jks` |
| `KNIT_DIST_STORE_PASSWORD` | keystore password |
| `KNIT_DIST_KEY_ALIAS` | `knit-dist` |
| `KNIT_DIST_KEY_PASSWORD` | key password |

They feed `KNIT_SIGNING_*` env vars (`KNIT_UPLOAD_*` still works; the neutral name exists because this
path must never be confused with the Play upload key). The keystore is decoded to `$RUNNER_TEMP`, shredded
in an `if: always()` step, and never enters the workspace or an artifact.

Three things the workflow checks that no local build does:

- **The signing certificate equals `AllowedAPKSigningKeys`.** Signing the public APK with the Play upload
  key is the one unrecoverable mistake here, and it is otherwise invisible until users can't update.
- **The APK is reproducible.** A parallel job rebuilds the same tag *unsigned* inside
  `registry.gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver:buildserver` with no secrets and no Gradle cache, and
  `apksigcopier compare` (the same tool `fdroid verify` uses) proves the signed APK is that build plus a
  signature. A GitHub runner is a third build environment; reproducibility was only ever proven between
  the maintainer's machine and F-Droid's container. Nothing publishes if they diverge.
- **No VCS stamp, all four ABIs.** Cheap regression guards on the two things most likely to silently
  change what gets shipped.

To build one by hand instead: `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease` with `keystore.properties` pointed at
`knit-dist.jks`, then attach the APK under the filename the `Binaries:` URL expects.

Play releases additionally pass `-Pknit.nativeSymbols=true` and use `knit-upload.jks`; see
`.private/` for the maintainer-only store workflow.
