# Architecture decision records

Terse index of the load-bearing decisions and *why* they hold, so future work stays consistent. Each
points to the `context/` file with the full reasoning. Append new ADRs; change `Status:` to `Superseded`
rather than deleting. Dates are given where grounded; toolchain choices predate the 1.0 baseline.

## 001. DI is Koin, not Hilt

Status: Accepted

Hilt's Gradle plugin is broken on AGP 9.x in this window (dagger#5083 / #5099). Koin is pure-Kotlin
runtime DI with no Gradle plugin / annotation processor, so AGP can't break it. Detail:
`context/toolchain.md`.

## 002. Built-in Kotlin is overridden to 2.4.0 (not AGP's bundled 2.2.10)

Status: Accepted

The Kotlin-2.2 compiler can't read class metadata produced by Kotlin 2.4. KGP 2.4.0 goes on the root
buildscript classpath. Bumping AGP does not move Kotlin — the override is the lever. Detail:
`context/toolchain.md`.

## 003. Two radios behind one `MeshTransport` seam, no GMS/Nearby

Status: Accepted

Wi-Fi Aware (NAN) + Bluetooth LE run simultaneously behind `CompositeMeshTransport` (Bluetooth
preferred). Direct `android.*` radio APIs, no Google Nearby / GMS, so a device with only one radio still
meshes. Import boundary is enforced as a rule (`rules/mesh.md`); detail: `context/mesh-transport.md`.

## 004. Two-plane NAN design (cue plane + ephemeral NDP) with an accept-any responder

Status: Accepted · Re-audited 2026-07-04 (`docs/NAN_CONCURRENCY_REAUDIT.md`)

`maxNdiInterfaces == 1` is per-*role*: a single accept-any responder multiplexes many inbound NDPs, but
each initiator needs its own NDI. So coordination rides Wi-Fi Aware messages (no data path) and data rides
one ephemeral NDP brought up only for a digest-differing peer. Per-peer responders don't compose. Detail:
`context/mesh-transport.md`. A concurrent-serve redesign is proposed in
`docs/NAN_CONCURRENCY_REAUDIT.md` §5.

## 005. Layered opaque-CBOR wire + one frame signature

Status: Accepted

Three layers (`WireEnvelope` / `RelayEnvelope` / per-type content) of opaque `@ByteString` CBOR so a relay
rewrites only ttl/hops and passes `signed`+`sig` byte-for-byte — one Ed25519 signature authenticates every
type. Evolves additively. Detail: `context/wire-format.md`; break rules: `docs/WIRE_COMPAT.md`.

## 006. Convergent custody quota (frame-global `sentAt`, live-only, `ORIGIN_SELF` included)

Status: Accepted (DB v18, `forward_store.sentAt`)

The cue plane brings up a scarce NDP only when two peers' content digests differ, so the custody bound
must be identical on every node or the mesh churns forever. Evict newest-N by frame-global `(sentAt, id)`
on every origin, fold live ids only. Makes TTL constants convergence-critical. Detail:
`context/store-and-forward.md`.

## 007. Static analysis via standalone CLI; Kover is the one plugin exception

Status: Superseded by 011

detekt/ktlint run as standalone CLIs in isolated root-build configs so they can't perturb `:app`'s
Kotlin-2.4 classpath. Coverage must instrument bytecode, so Kover is the deliberate plugin exception
(low-risk, no codegen; keep ≥ 0.9.8). Detail: `context/toolchain.md`.

## 008. DB v1 is the frozen launch baseline — migrations mandatory from v1

Status: Accepted

No destructive fallback: every `@Database` bump adds a tested `Migration` + a migration-test case; a
missing migration throws at open time (caught in CI). Pre-1.0 destructive v2…v22 history is collapsed.
Detail: `context/testing.md`; break record: `docs/WIRE_COMPAT.md`.

## 009. One shared "message request vs accepted" predicate (`Conversations.isAccepted`)

Status: Accepted

The Message Requests rule — a conversation is *accepted* (not a stranger's request) iff it is Nearby ∨
in the accepted set ∨ the DM peer is verified ∨ the user has authored in it — is the single source of
truth for the local notify gate (`InboundPipeline`), the retention sweep (`MeshManager.sweepLocalStorage`),
and the Message Requests UI (`ui/requests/`, chat-list partition). It lives as a **pure, Android-free**
function in `data/message/Conversations.kt` taking the three signals as sets, so a per-conversation check
and a whole-list partition share one rule that can't drift. It is a **local presentation decision only** —
never folded into custody/relay, so it is *not* convergence-critical (unlike the custody quota in ADR 006).

## 010. Blocking is local presentation only — a blocked sender's broadcast/group message is still acked

Status: Accepted

Blocking suppresses *surfacing* (persist / notify / group-roster reconcile) but must not change what the
mesh observes about delivery. `InboundPipeline.handleChat` therefore still sends the best-effort
broadcast/group delivery tick for a blocked sender (`ackBlockedRoomChat` → `AckSync.owe`); it only skips
the local surfacing. Two reasons: (1) blocking must stay **invisible** to the blocked party; (2) that
broadcast/group receipt is a *fragile* unicast `relay = false` tick (unlike a DM's flooded, custodied
one), so when the blocker is the sender's only reachable acker, dropping it strands their Nearby/group
✓✓ forever — the observed 4-phone bug. A **DM is deliberately still not acked**: its receipt floods and
is custodied (real delay-tolerance, no single-hop trap) and acking it would also vaccine-purge it from
mesh-wide custody. This is a local-delivery-path decision (like ADR 009), never folded into custody/relay,
so it is not convergence-critical. Regression tests: `InboundPipelineTest` (broadcast/group acked, DM not).

## 011. Static analysis + Room schema run as Gradle plugins (supersedes 007)

Status: Accepted (2026-07-08, branch `build/gradle-plugins`)

Reverses ADR 007's "standalone CLI" doctrine. detekt (`dev.detekt` 2.0.x — the first line supporting
Gradle 9; 1.23.x capped at Gradle 8.12.1), ktlint (`org.jlleitschuh.gradle.ktlint` 14.x), and Room schema
export (`androidx.room`) now run as ordinary Gradle plugins. Safe because each analyzer runs in its own
isolated task classpath and adds nothing to `:app`'s compile/runtime graph (verified: `assembleDebug` +
`lint` unaffected), so the Kotlin-2.4-metadata hazard that motivated the CLIs (and Koin-not-Hilt, ADR 001)
doesn't apply — none does compile-time codegen on `:app`'s sources. Kover was already a plugin (its old
"one exception" framing is retired). ktlint's check task is now `ktlintCheck` (and `ktlintFormat`
autocorrects); the CI `verify:detekt` job runs `./gradlew detekt` (a `verify:ktlint` job was added).
Detail: `context/toolchain.md`.

## 012. R8 obfuscation (name mangling) enabled — the wire stays safe by construction

Status: Accepted (2026-07-09)

Release/staging now shrink + optimize + **obfuscate** (removed the lone `-dontobfuscate`; R8 full mode).
Safe because the wire is kotlinx.serialization compiler-plugin CBOR/JSON: map keys are the literal property
spellings baked into the generated `$$serializer` descriptors at compile time (no `@SerialName` / no
polymorphism / no reflective lookup), which R8 does not rewrite — so renaming is byte-safe as long as the
`$$serializer` infra is kept. Belt-and-suspenders: the frozen wire/identity DTOs (`mesh.protocol.**`,
`MessageContent`, `PublicKeyBundle$Proto`, `FileHeaderWire`/`DigestWire`, `IdentityKeyStore$Stored`) are
pinned unrenamed in `keepRules/knit-r8.keep`, and `-keepattributes SourceFile,LineNumberTable,…` keeps stack
traces symbolicatable. The one name-coupled path — `FileKind` serialized by *constant name* over the JSON
file-header sidecar — is fixed in **code** (`FileKind.wire` / `FileKind.fromWire`, frozen "AVATAR"/
"ATTACHMENT" tokens), not a keep rule, so a regression can't be masked. `mapping.txt` is now the
deobfuscation map — retain it per release. **Runtime gotcha found + fixed on enablement:** the first
obfuscated on-device launch crashed with `IncompatibleClassChangeError` because kxml2 (transitive via
ARSCLib) bundles `org.xmlpull.v1.*` into the apk, so R8 full mode renamed the *platform* `XmlPullParser`
interface and the framework's `XmlBlock$Parser` no longer satisfied it during resource-XML (vector/font)
inflation — fixed by pinning `-keep class org.xmlpull.v1.**` (see the keep-file section). Verified: the
obfuscated staging build launches and renders on an API-37 emulator. The broad library `{ *; }` keeps
(Tink/SQLCipher/TFLite/ARSCLib) are intentionally left un-tightened (a separate follow-up). Detail: the `keepRules/knit-r8.keep` header + the
release buildType comment; wire-break rules: `docs/WIRE_COMPAT.md`.

## 013. Accessibility checks run via Compose's ATF integration, not Espresso

Status: Accepted (2026-07-09, branch `build/accessability-test-framework`)

The Play Console pre-launch report runs Google's Accessibility Test Framework (ATF). We run the *same*
framework locally so a11y regressions (missing labels, sub-48dp targets, low contrast, bad traversal) fail
before upload. Knit is Compose-only and uses **no** Espresso view actions, so ATF's classic
`AccessibilityChecks.enable()` (an Espresso `ViewAction` hook) has nothing to fire on — the right seam is
Compose's own `androidx.compose.ui:ui-test-junit4-accessibility` (`compose.enableAccessibilityChecks(...)` +
`onRoot().tryPerformAccessibilityChecks()`), which pulls ATF transitively. The suite
(`app/src/androidTest/…/a11y/`, `AccessibilityInstrumentedTest`) reuses the seeded `SeededUiTest` harness to
deep-link and audit each screen. **Gated to API 34+**: the Compose ATF API is `@RequiresApi(34)`, so tests
carry `@SdkSuppress(minSdkVersion = 34)` (skip, don't fail, on older devices; also the lint `NewApi` guard —
`@RequiresApi` in a test is rejected by lint's `UseSdkSuppress`) and run on a new `pixel8api34` managed
emulator / FTL API-34+ device. **Gate policy**: errors fail the test, warnings/info are logged (validator
`setThrowExceptionFor(ERROR)` + `addCheckListener`). Detail: `context/testing.md`.

## 014. F-Droid ships *our* signed APK (reproducible `Binaries:`), not an F-Droid-signed rebuild

Status: Accepted (2026-07-21)

F-Droid offers two publishing models: it builds from source and signs with **its own** key, or — with
`Binaries:` + `AllowedAPKSigningKeys` — it rebuilds from source, byte-compares against the APK we publish,
and on a match distributes **ours**. We take the second, which Meshtastic (`metadata/com.geeksville.mesh.yml`)
also uses.

The deciding argument is Knit-specific, not ideological. `ui/invite/ShareApk.kt` hands a nearby phone this
app's own APK over Quick Share/Bluetooth — offline app distribution is a *product feature*. Under
F-Droid-signed builds the F-Droid APK would carry a different certificate from the one we hand out, so a
peer who received Knit over the mesh could never take an in-place update from F-Droid. One
distribution-key-signed APK serving GitHub Releases, F-Droid, sideload, and mesh-share keeps that coherent.
It is also a **one-way door**: publishing an F-Droid-signed APK first and switching later would break every
existing install. Play is unavoidably separate — Play App Signing holds a key we don't have.

Consequences, all load-bearing (detail: `context/distribution.md`):

- **The release APK must not depend on the build machine.** Native-symbol extraction (`ndkVersion` +
  `debugSymbolLevel`) is gated behind `-Pknit.nativeSymbols=true` — the Play AAB path only — because AGP's
  strip step degrades *silently* without an NDK. `packaging { jniLibs { keepDebugSymbols } }` opts out of
  stripping explicitly instead. Measured cost: **+8 bytes**; the shipped `.so` were already stripped
  upstream, so the strip was always a no-op. Verified: `clean` + `assembleRelease` reproduces an identical
  sha256 across full rebuilds.
- **No VCS stamping.** `vcsInfo { include = false }` on release. AGP otherwise embeds the builder's HEAD
  revision in `META-INF/version-control-info.textproto`. Verified empirically: rebuilding this commit inside
  F-Droid's actual buildserver container reproduced the APK byte-for-byte *except* this single entry (1 of
  185, same total size) — it was the whole delta.
- **No JDK auto-provisioning.** The `foojay-resolver-convention` plugin is gone from `settings.gradle.kts`
  and the `toolchainUrl.*` lines are stripped from `gradle/gradle-daemon-jvm.properties`; both fetch an
  unpinned compiler over the network. Gradle now fails loudly and the recipe installs JDK 21 via `sudo:`.
- **Git LFS is banned.** F-Droid's buildserver has no LFS support (fdroidserver#1190), and the moderators
  degrade to allow-all on an unreadable model — LFS would ship a silently unmoderated app. `*.tflite` are
  plain blobs, and `checkModerationModels` hard-fails on a pointer stub.
- **A Gradle property, never a product flavor.** Adding a flavor would move Room's exported schema off the
  flat `app/schemas/<db>/<version>.json` path that `KnitDatabaseMigrationTest` reads (`context/toolchain.md`).
- **The tag must equal `v<versionName>`** — fdroiddata expands `%v` to versionName in both `Binaries:` and
  `AutoUpdateMode`. Hence 2.2.0, not the 2.1 / `v2.1.0` mismatch shipped at 2.1.0.

## 015. QR scanning is CameraX + zxing core, not zxing-android-embedded

Status: Accepted (2026-07-31)

`com.journeyapps:zxing-android-embedded:4.3.0` hard-crashed the "Scan their code" flow for an F-Droid
reviewer ("Knit has stopped") on hardware the maintainer's Pixel 7/8/9 XL could not reproduce. Cause,
found by tracing the shipped 2.2.1 APK: the library runs its decode loop on a bare `HandlerThread` with
**no `try`/`catch` anywhere in the chain** —
`DecoderThread.handleMessage → decode → createSource → RawImageData.cropAndScale` — and crops the preview
buffer using the frame geometry the camera *reported* rather than what it *delivered*. Where those
disagree (ordinary camera-HAL variance) `System.arraycopy` throws `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` off the
main thread and the process dies. Its one guard compares the Y-plane size against a 1.5x NV21 buffer, so a
mismatch slips through. R8, resource shrinking, the manifest merge and the permission declarations were all
cleared first — this was never a build-config problem.

It could not be patched in place: `BarcodeView.startDecoderThread()` is `private` and constructs
`DecoderThread` directly, so the only public seam (`DecoderFactory`) sits *downstream* of the throw. The
library was last released Feb 2021 and still drives the deprecated Camera1 API, which is where the device
variance comes from in the first place.

So we own the analyze loop: **CameraX** (`camera-core`/`camera2`/`lifecycle`/`view`) drives the camera and
**zxing core** — already a dependency, it renders the identity QR in `ui/image/QrCode.kt` — decodes.

- **`ui/scan/QrDecoder.kt` is deliberately Android-free**, so the arithmetic that broke the old library is
  a plain-JVM unit-test target (`QrDecoderTest` pins padded `rowStride`, `pixelStride > 1`, truncated
  buffers and degenerate geometry). Robolectric was avoided on purpose — it intermittently crashes Gradle
  9.5's test-result serialization in this suite.
- **`QrDecoder.decode` never throws.** Any frame — mis-strided, truncated, absurdly sized, or simply
  without a code — yields `null`. A camera frame must not be able to take the app down. Rotation handling
  is gone too: zxing finds QR finder patterns in any orientation, which deletes the rotate-and-crop stage
  that crashed.
- **The scanner is a composable, not an Activity or `Dialog`** (`ui/scan/QrScannerContent.kt`), rendered in
  place of the calling screen's content. Screens here take lambdas and `KnitApp` owns navigation; a camera
  `SurfaceView` in a `Dialog` window has z-ordering quirks on exactly the hardware this exists to support.
- **CameraX 1.6.1 is pinned against four constraints** — `minCompileSdk=36`, no upgrade pressure on the
  pinned lifecycle/core, 16 KB-page-aligned `.so`, and its own consumer R8 rules. Re-check all four before
  bumping; they are spelled out at the `cameraX` pin in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`.
- **Never add `camera-mlkit-vision`** — it pulls GMS, which this app does not ship.

The four-ABI `.so` CameraX adds ride the existing `keepDebugSymbols` no-strip opt-out, so ADR 014's
reproducibility contract is unaffected (verified: unstripped, timestamps normalized). Detail:
`context/distribution.md`.
