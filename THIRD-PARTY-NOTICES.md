# Third-Party Notices

Knit is licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 or later** (see [`COPYING`](COPYING)).
It redistributes, and depends on, the third-party open-source components listed below. Every component
shipped in the Knit APK is under a **GPL-compatible** license (Apache-2.0, BSD, or MIT); the project
deliberately carries **no Google Play services / GMS** dependency.

This file is provided for attribution and to satisfy the notice-retention terms of the Apache License
2.0 (§4), the BSD license, and the MIT license. Where a component ships its own `NOTICE` file, that
notice is incorporated here by reference. The full text of the Apache License 2.0 is available at

## Bundled ML models and data

- **On-device moderation models** — the NSFW image classifier (MIT, © 2020 The nsfw_model Developers)
  and the toxicity text classifier (Apache-2.0, derived from Detoxify / ALBERT) bundled under
  `app/src/main/assets/moderation/` are third-party works redistributed under their own licenses. The
  full notices, source URLs, and license texts are in
  [`app/src/main/assets/moderation/README.md`](app/src/main/assets/moderation/README.md).
- **`profanity_en.txt`** — the deterministic profanity word list under `app/src/main/assets/moderation/`
  is a derived work generated from [dsojevic/profanity-list](https://github.com/dsojevic/profanity-list)
  (MIT, © 2021 David Sojevic), pinned at commit `c27924319aa9bd6f917e3782b4f4b6604a50b652`, by
  `scripts/gen-profanity-list.py`. It is redistributed under the MIT License; the full license text,
  source URL, pinned commit, and transform/curation rules are in
  [`app/src/main/assets/moderation/README.md`](app/src/main/assets/moderation/README.md).

## Build- and test-only dependencies (not distributed)

The following are used only to build, lint, or test Knit and are **not** shipped in the APK, so their
licenses do not affect redistribution of the app: JUnit 4 (EPL-1.0), MockK, Robolectric, Espresso and
the AndroidX Test libraries, UIAutomator, Room testing, Koin test (all Apache-2.0), and the detekt,
ktlint, and Kover build tooling. JUnit's EPL-1.0 license is GPL-incompatible for *distribution*, but
JUnit is never distributed with Knit — it is a test-scope dependency only.

When you add, remove, or upgrade a **shipped** dependency, update this file so the attribution list
stays accurate (see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)).
