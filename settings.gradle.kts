// NO foojay-resolver-convention here, deliberately. That plugin auto-downloads a JDK from api.foojay.io
// when the requested toolchain isn't installed locally. This project already requires JDK 21 (see
// gradle/gradle-daemon-jvm.properties and .agents/rules/build-and-test.md), and for a build that has to be
// byte-reproducible on someone else's machine, "silently fetch a JDK over the network" is the wrong
// failure mode twice over: it makes the compiler a moving, unpinned input, and it needs outbound network
// F-Droid's buildserver may not grant. Without it Gradle fails loudly with "no matching toolchain", which
// the builder fixes by installing JDK 21 (the fdroiddata recipe does this in its `sudo:` block).
// For reference, apps that keep this plugin have to get it patched out of their F-Droid recipe — see
// `prebuild: sed -i -e '/foojay-resolver/d' ../settings.gradle.kts` in metadata/com.geeksville.mesh.yml.
