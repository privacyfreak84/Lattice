# Shared guard for the `gradle-*-stop.sh` Stop hooks.
#
# The Gradle tasks these hooks enforce (lint, detekt, ktlintCheck, testDebugUnitTest)
# only consume Android/build inputs: the `app/` module, the `gradle/` version catalog + wrapper, the
# `config/` tool configs, the root build scripts, `.editorconfig` (ktlint), and the root lockfile.
# A turn that only touched Markdown, docs, `.agents/`, `.claude/`, or shell scripts can't change their
# result, so running them is pure wasted wall-clock. Source this and early-exit when nothing relevant
# changed:
#
#   source "$project_dir/.claude/hooks/lib/gradle-input-guard.sh"
#   gradle_inputs_changed || exit 0
#
# `gradle_inputs_changed` returns 0 (run the task) / 1 (skip it):
#   * dirty tree  -> decide from the uncommitted change set (tracked-vs-HEAD + untracked).
#                    Any Gradle input changed -> run; changes exist but none are inputs -> skip.
#   * clean tree  -> decide from the last commit's files (HEAD~1..HEAD), so code that was edited AND
#                    committed in the same turn still gets validated, while a docs-only commit is
#                    skipped.
#   * uncertain   -> run (fail-safe: never skip validation when we can't read git state). A clean tree
#                    with no prior commit, or no git repo at all, falls through to here.
#
# Skipping is therefore strictly additive: behavior only changes for a change set that touches no
# Gradle input at all (the "only Markdown was modified" case).

# Repo-root-relative paths (forward slashes, no leading ./) that are inputs to the Gradle tasks.
